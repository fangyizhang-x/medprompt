Given the clinical presentation of this 11-year-old girl, we can deduce that she is experiencing meningitis, which is a common complication in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) due to their compromised immune system. The symptoms and signs suggest an infection in the central nervous system (CNS), including high-grade fever, headache, nausea, stiff neck, decreased muscle strength, and altered mental status.

The key findings that guide our next steps are:

1. **Acute lymphoblastic leukemia**: This patient has a history of chemotherapy 2 weeks ago, which increases her risk for infections.
2. **High-grade fever and headache**: These symptoms can be indicative of meningitis or encephalitis.
3. **Nausea and vomiting**: These symptoms can also be associated with CNS infections.
4. **Stiff neck and decreased muscle strength in the right upper extremity**: These findings suggest a possible spinal cord involvement, which is common in meningitis.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a lumbar puncture (LP) to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. This procedure can help identify the causative organism of the infection, assess the severity of the infection, and guide further treatment decisions.

A CT scan of the head is not necessary at this stage as there are no specific indications for imaging in the emergency department setting. An MRI of the brain might be considered later if the LP does not yield any diagnostic information or if there are concerns about the patient's condition that require more detailed imaging.

Antibiotic therapy (C) may be appropriate after obtaining the CSF analysis, but it should not be initiated without first confirming the diagnosis through LP. Antibiotics alone would not address the underlying cause of meningitis and could potentially worsen the condition if the causative organism is resistant to treatment.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is a lumbar puncture (D) to obtain CSF analysis and guide further treatment decisions.
