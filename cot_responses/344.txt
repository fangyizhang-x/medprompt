## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, recent travel history to Minnesota, and the presence of violaceous vesiculopustular lesions on both wrists and hands, we can narrow down the differential diagnosis.

Firstly, the fact that the patient is sexually active with a partner who uses a diaphragm for contraception suggests a possible sexually transmitted infection (STI). However, the presence of multiple painful lesions on the wrists and hands, as well as swelling and erythema of the left wrist, points more towards an autoimmune or rheumatological condition rather than a typical STI.

The patient's recent travel history to Minnesota is also relevant. Lyme disease is endemic in this region, and its rash can appear at any time but often becomes more pronounced after exposure to ticks. The presence of violaceous vesiculopustular lesions on the wrists and hands is a classic presentation of erythema migrans, which is a hallmark of Lyme disease.

Considering the patient's symptoms and travel history, we can rule out some options:

* Acute rheumatic fever (B) is less likely given the absence of carditis or arthritis symptoms.
* Disseminated gonococcal infection (C) typically presents with joint pain, fever, and rash, but the presence of violaceous vesiculopustular lesions on both wrists and hands makes this diagnosis less likely.

Reactive arthritis (D) is a form of arthritis that occurs as a reaction to an infection elsewhere in the body, often in the gastrointestinal tract or genitourinary tract. While it can present with joint pain and rash, the presence of violaceous vesiculopustular lesions on both wrists and hands makes this diagnosis less likely.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Lyme arthritis (A), which is a tick-borne illness caused by Borrelia burgdorferi that can cause a characteristic rash and joint pain. The patient's symptoms, travel history, and presence of violaceous vesiculopustular lesions on both wrists and hands make this diagnosis the most plausible explanation.

The final answer is: A
