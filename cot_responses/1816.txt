(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's acute-onset severe abdominal pain, history of vague but recurrent episodes of abdominal pain that resolve after eating, and physical examination findings of a flat and rigid abdomen, the most appropriate next step in evaluating her discomfort and stomach pain is to perform light palpation at the point of maximal pain.

This approach is based on the principle of "sharp pain" which is typically associated with visceral organs such as the stomach or intestines. Sharp pain is often described as stabbing or shooting, whereas dull pain is more diffuse and aching. By performing light palpation at the point of maximal pain, healthcare providers can assess for tenderness, guarding (muscle tension), and rebound tenderness, which are common signs of visceral organ involvement.

The other options are not appropriate next steps in this scenario:

A. Shifting dullness of the abdomen is typically associated with liver or right upper quadrant abdominal pathology, which may not be directly related to the patient's current presentation.

B. Percussing the point of maximal pain can provide information about the presence and location of a mass or organ, but it may not be the most sensitive or specific method for evaluating visceral organs in this context.

D. Auscultating the abdomen (listening to sounds) is more relevant when assessing for bowel obstruction or other conditions that may cause abdominal distension or rumbling noises, which are not indicated in this scenario.

Therefore, light palpation at the point of maximal pain is the most appropriate initial step in evaluating this patient's discomfort and stomach pain.
