(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a bacterial conjunctivitis, specifically a purulent conjunctivitis due to staphylococcal infection. The presence of yellow crusts on the eyelids (chili red or "stuck together" feeling) and purulent discharge are indicative of an active infection.

The patient's history of nasal allergies and recent sexual activity increase her risk for sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia and gonorrhea, which can cause conjunctivitis. The lack of symptoms such as fever, headache, or photophobia does not rule out a bacterial infection.

Considering the severity of the symptoms and the potential for complications, such as corneal ulcers or perforation, topical antibiotics are necessary to treat the infection. Among the options provided:

A. Topical natamycin is an antifungal agent that would be more appropriate if the patient had a fungal conjunctivitis.

B. Topical prednisolone acetate is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation and swelling but is not indicated for bacterial infections.

C. Topical erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including staphylococci, which are likely responsible for the patient's infection.

D. Oral erythromycin would be more appropriate if the patient had a bacterial conjunctivitis caused by a Gram-positive bacterium, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae type b. However, given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, which are more suggestive of a staphylococcal infection, oral erythromycin is not the most appropriate choice.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is topical erythromycin to treat the bacterial conjunctivitis caused by staphylococcus.
