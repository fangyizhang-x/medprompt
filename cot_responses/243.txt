## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's presentation and laboratory findings suggest a bleeding disorder, particularly given the prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) postoperatively. Here's my step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Normal PT and INR**: The normal prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.0 indicate that the extrinsic and common coagulation pathways are functioning normally, which helps to rule out conditions like disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), where both PT and INR would be abnormal.

2. **Normal platelet count**: A normal platelet count suggests that thrombocytopenia is not a contributing factor to the bleeding observed during surgery or postoperatively.

3. **Massive and persistent bleeding requiring blood transfusion**: This indicates a problem with coagulation, specifically with factors involved in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation.

4. **Family history of an unknown bleeding disorder**: This raises the suspicion of a genetic bleeding disorder that could be inherited.

5. **Prolonged PTT postoperatively**: A prolonged PTT is indicative of a problem with the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, which involves factors such as factor VIII, IX, XI, and XII.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

A. **Hemophilia A**: This condition is characterized by a deficiency in factor VIII, leading to a prolonged PTT. However, it typically presents with joint pain, muscle weakness, and bleeding into joints or muscles, which are not mentioned in this patient's presentation.

B. **Bernard-Soulier syndrome**: This is a rare inherited disorder affecting platelet function due to a deficiency of glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex on the surface of platelets. It typically presents with thrombocytopenia and petechiae, which are not mentioned in this patient's presentation.

C. **Glanzman syndrome (Thrombasthenia)**: This is an inherited bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex on platelets, leading to impaired aggregation. It typically presents with easy bruising and petechiae, which are not mentioned in this patient's presentation.

D. **Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)**: This is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the formation of blood clots
