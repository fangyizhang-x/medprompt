## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's age, smoking history, and the description of the skin lesion as partly elevated on palpation without changing its form on pinching, we can rule out some options.

Firstly, let's consider the location of the lesion. The chest is a common site for various types of skin lesions, but when considering the options provided, Keratoacanthoma (B) and Basal Cell Carcinoma (D) are less likely due to their typical locations on sun-exposed areas like the face or hands.

Malignant melanoma (A) is also unlikely in this case because it typically presents as a new, rapidly growing lesion that changes its appearance over time. The fact that the lesion has increased in size and does not change its form suggests a more benign process.

Lentigo maligna (C), on the other hand, is a type of skin cancer that typically occurs on sun-exposed areas like the face, especially in older adults with a history of sun exposure. It often presents as a slowly growing lesion that may appear to be changing over time. Given the patient's age and the fact that the lesion has increased in size without changing its form, Lentigo Maligna is a more likely diagnosis.

Keratoacanthoma (B) is also less likely due to its typical location on sun-exposed areas like the face or hands, which does not match the chest location of this patient's skin lesion. Additionally, Keratoacanthomas are typically solitary and may appear as a single, well-defined nodule.

Therefore, based on the patient's age, smoking history, and the description of the skin lesion, the most likely diagnosis is Lentigo Maligna.
