## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's define the variables:
- P(AD) = probability of having AD = 1/2 (since half of the patients enrolled have AD)
- P(AD positive) = probability of being positive on the PET exam given that you have AD = 400 / 1000 = 4/10
- P(AD negative) = probability of not having AD and not being positive on the PET exam = 1 - P(AD) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2
- P(AD positive control) = probability of being positive on the PET exam given that you do not have AD = 50 / 1000 = 1/20

Now, let's calculate the PPV (Positive Predictive Value):
PPV = P(AD positive) / [P(AD positive) + P(AD negative)]

## Step 1: Calculate P(AD positive)
P(AD positive) = 400 / 1000 = 4/10

## Step 2: Calculate P(AD negative)
P(AD negative) = 1 - P(AD) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2

## Step 3: Plug in the values into the PPV formula
PPV = (400 / 1000) / [(4/10) + (1/2)]

## Step 4: Simplify the denominator of the fraction
First, convert all fractions to have a common denominator:
(4/10) = (2/5)
(1/2) = (5/10)

Now add them together:
(2/5) + (5/10) = (4/10) + (5/10) = 9/10

## Step 5: Plug in the simplified denominator into the PPV formula
PPV = (400 / 1000) / [9/10]

## Step 6: Simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 100.
PPV = (4/10) / (9/10)
= (4 * 10) / (10 * 9)
= 40 / 90

## Step 7: Reduce the fraction to its simplest form
The greatest common divisor of 40 and 90 is 10. Divide both numerator and denominator by
