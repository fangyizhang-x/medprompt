(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine which option is indicative of metastatic disease in a patient with prostatic adenocarcinoma, let's analyze each choice step by step:

A. Elevated Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) - PAP levels are often elevated in prostate cancer due to the increased production of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). However, this elevation can also be seen in benign conditions such as prostatitis or prostatic hyperplasia. While an elevated PAP level may suggest a possible metastatic process, it is not specific enough to confirm metastasis.

B. Involvement of the periurethral zone - The periurethral zone is a common site for prostate cancer metastases. However, involvement of this area alone does not necessarily indicate metastatic disease.

C. New-onset lower back pain - Lower back pain can be associated with various conditions, including prostate cancer. While it may suggest bone metastasis, which could be a sign of advanced disease, it is not specific to metastatic disease and can also be seen in other conditions such as osteoporosis or spinal stenosis.

D. Palpation of a hard nodule on digital rectal examination - This option is more indicative of metastatic disease. A hard nodule palpable during a digital rectal examination (DRE) is often associated with prostate cancer, particularly if it is located in the peripheral zone of the prostate. The presence of such a nodule can be an indicator of local spread or invasion into surrounding tissues.

Therefore, based on the analysis of each option, the most indicative sign of metastatic disease in this patient would be the palpation of a hard nodule on digital rectal examination.
