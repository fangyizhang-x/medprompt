Given the patient's presentation and the findings from the speculum exam, transvaginal ultrasound, and the empty gestational sac on ultrasound, the most likely diagnosis is a missed abortion or a molar pregnancy.

The open cervical os and blood clots within the vaginal vault are consistent with these diagnoses. The fact that the uterus is consistent in size with a 12-week gestation further supports this suspicion.

Expectant management (A) may not be appropriate given the patient's symptoms of abdominal cramping, which could indicate a more serious condition such as a retained placental abruption or a molar pregnancy.

Methotrexate therapy (B) is typically used for early pregnancy loss, especially if there are no other indications for medical intervention. However, in this case, the empty gestational sac on ultrasound makes methotrexate less likely to be beneficial.

Serial beta-hCG measurement (C) may provide some information about the patient's condition, but it will not help determine the cause of her symptoms or guide management.

Oxytocin therapy (D) is often used in cases where there is a need for uterine contractions to facilitate evacuation of the uterus. However, given the empty gestational sac on ultrasound and the presence of blood clots within the vaginal vault, this may not be necessary at this time.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform an ultrasound-guided dilation and curettage (DUC) to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. This procedure can help determine if there is a retained product of conception or a molar pregnancy that needs to be evacuated, and it allows for the collection of tissue samples for histopathological examination.

The patient's concern about undergoing invasive procedures should also be addressed by explaining the risks and benefits of DUC in the context of her symptoms and the ultrasound findings. It is essential to reassure her that while DUC carries some risks, it can be a safe procedure when performed by an experienced practitioner in a controlled environment.
