## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Decreased compliance of the left ventricle (A)**: While decreased left ventricular compliance can lead to increased filling pressures and potentially heart failure symptoms, it is not directly related to the physical examination finding described.

2. **Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve (B)**: This condition typically presents with mitral regurgitation, which would likely be associated with a murmur heard during cardiac examination, particularly in the second or third heart sound. However, there is no specific mention of a murmur in the question stem.

3. **Inflammation of the pericardium (C)**: Pericarditis can cause chest pain and may lead to an elevated temperature. While it could potentially affect cardiac examination findings, such as a pericardial friction rub or decreased cardiac output due to inflammation, there is no direct indication in the question stem.

4. **Dilation of the aortic root (D)**: This condition, known as aortic dilation or dilatation of the ascending aorta, can be associated with hypertension and may lead to an increased pulse pressure. The physical examination finding described, including the widened pulse pressure (145/95 mm Hg), is highly suggestive of this condition.

Given the patient's hypertension and the specific findings on cardiac examination, which include a wide pulse pressure, the most likely cause of this physical examination finding is **dilation of the aortic root**. This is because hypertension can lead to concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, which in turn can cause the aortic root to dilate.

Therefore, the answer is D.
