## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, the most pressing concern is her elevated blood pressure (165/95 mmHg), which indicates hypertension. The presence of a bruit in the abdominal region suggests renal artery stenosis, a condition that can cause hypertension due to decreased blood flow to the kidneys.

The patient's past medical history of asthma and anxiety does not directly relate to her current presentation, but it is worth noting for future consideration if she develops any new symptoms related to these conditions.

The patient's current medications are well-controlled, with albuterol for asthma and fexofenadine for allergies. However, the addition of lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) may be considered in patients with hypertension, especially those with a history of kidney disease or diabetes mellitus. The patient's bruit and elevated blood pressure suggest that her renal function is likely not optimal.

The cardiac exam reveals a S1 and S2 heart sound without any abnormalities, which is consistent with the normal heart sounds expected for someone with no known cardiovascular disease. However, the presence of a bruit in the abdominal region warrants further investigation to rule out other potential causes of hypertension.

Given these considerations, the best next step in management would be to perform an ultrasound with Doppler to evaluate the renal arteries and assess for signs of stenosis or occlusion. This will help determine if the patient's hypertension is related to her renal artery stenosis and guide further management.

## Answer Choices:
A. Raise lisinopril dose - While considering increasing the dose of lisinopril may be beneficial, it is not the immediate next step in managing this patient's hypertension.
B. Add furosemide - Furosemide is a diuretic that may help manage hypertension by reducing fluid volume and blood pressure. However, adding a new medication without further evaluation may not be necessary at this time.
C. Ultrasound with Doppler - This is the most appropriate next step in management, as it will help determine if the patient's hypertension is related to her renal artery stenosis.
D. No additional management needed - Given the presence of a bruit and elevated blood pressure, further evaluation is necessary before deciding on any additional management strategies.

Therefore, the best answer is C.
