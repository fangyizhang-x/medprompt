## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine the primary mechanism of particle clearance in this scenario, let's consider the role of each cell type mentioned:

- **Goblet cells**: These are responsible for producing and secreting mucus, which helps to trap particles and debris. While goblet cells play a crucial role in respiratory health by protecting against infections and maintaining airway patency, they are not primarily involved in particle clearance.

- **Type I pneumocytes**: These cells line the alveoli and are responsible for gas exchange between the lungs and the bloodstream. They do not have a significant role in particle clearance.

- **Macrophages**: Macrophages are a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the immune response, including phagocytosing (engulfing and digesting) foreign particles and pathogens. In the context of respiratory clearance, macrophages can engulf and remove particulate matter from the alveoli.

- **Neutrophils**: These cells are primarily involved in the innate immune response against bacterial infections and are not typically associated with particle clearance in the lungs.

Given this information, the primary mechanism of particle clearance most likely involves macrophages, as they play a key role in engulfing and removing particulate matter from the alveoli. This process is crucial for maintaining lung function and overall respiratory health.

Therefore, the answer is C.
