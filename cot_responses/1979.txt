Given the patient's recent history of postpartum endometritis and her current symptoms, it is essential to consider a contraceptive method that does not exacerbate her condition or interfere with her recovery.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option:

A. Spermicide: This is a barrier method that can be used during sex, but it may not provide adequate protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and could potentially irritate the vaginal tissues, worsening postpartum endometritis symptoms.

B. Basal body temperature method: This is an ovulation predictor based on basal body temperature changes, which is not a reliable contraceptive method for preventing pregnancy.

C. Progestin-only contraceptive pills: These are often recommended as first-line contraception in women with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or other conditions that may increase the risk of endometritis. However, they can also affect lactation and breast tissue, which is not ideal given the patient's recent breastfeeding experience.

D. Combined oral contraceptives: These are generally contraindicated in postpartum women with a history of endometritis due to the increased risk of re-infection or exacerbation of the condition. Additionally, they can affect lactation and breast tissue, which may not be suitable for this patient.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate recommendation would be to avoid combined oral contraceptives (D) and spermicide (A), as they may not provide adequate protection against STIs and could potentially worsen postpartum endometritis symptoms. The basal body temperature method (B) is also not a reliable contraceptive option.

Therefore, the best choice for this patient would be progestin-only contraceptive pills (C), which are generally considered safe and effective in women with a history of PID or other conditions that may increase the risk of endometritis. However, it's essential to note that individual circumstances may vary, and further evaluation by a healthcare provider is recommended before starting any new contraceptive method.
