## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The correct answer is B. Root cause analysis.

Reasoning:

1. **Identifying the problem**: The committee's primary goal is to investigate the adenovirus outbreak and identify weaknesses in the current system.
2. **Reviewing charts and patient data**: This step involves analyzing data, which is a key aspect of root cause analysis (RCA). RCA aims to understand the underlying causes of an event or process by examining data, observations, and other relevant information.
3. **Interviewing care providers**: While interviewing care providers may provide valuable insights into potential factors contributing to the outbreak, it is not a primary method for identifying weaknesses in the current system.
4. **Investigating patient safety and sanitation measures**: This step involves reviewing existing policies and procedures, which is also a key aspect of RCA.

Root cause analysis (B) is the most appropriate choice because it involves systematically examining data, observations, and other relevant information to identify the underlying causes of an event or process. In this case, the committee's goal is to understand how adenovirus could have been spread from patient to patient, which requires identifying weaknesses in the current system.

Failure mode and effects analysis (A) is a type of fault tree analysis that focuses on identifying potential failures and their potential consequences. While it may be relevant to understanding the outbreak, it is not the most appropriate choice for this scenario.

Algorithmic analysis (C) involves using algorithms to analyze data or processes. It is not typically used in root cause analysis.

Heuristic analysis (D) involves using general knowledge or intuition to identify patterns or relationships between variables. While heuristic analysis may be useful in some cases, it is not the most appropriate choice for identifying weaknesses in a complex system like an ICU's patient safety and sanitation measures.
