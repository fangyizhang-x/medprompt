Given the patient's presentation of pain, swelling, and tenderness in his right big toe, particularly after a night of heavy drinking (3 beers), it is highly suggestive of gout. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in one or more joints, most often the big toe.

The patient's history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) also raises the possibility of uric acid nephropathy, which can lead to gout. Uric acid is a waste product that is produced by the body's breakdown of certain foods and substances, such as purines found in red meat, seafood, and some vegetables.

The physical examination findings are consistent with acute gouty arthritis, including erythema (redness), swelling, tenderness, and warmth over the affected joint. The presence of a swollen and hot right big toe is particularly suggestive of gout.

A joint fluid analysis is the most definitive test for diagnosing gout. In this context, it would likely show:

- Positively birefringent crystals: This refers to the characteristic appearance of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals under polarized light microscopy, which are a hallmark of gout.
- Negative birefringent crystals: This is less typical for acute gout and more suggestive of other conditions such as pseudogout or calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease.

Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient's joint fluid analysis would be positively birefringent crystals, which are characteristic of gout.
