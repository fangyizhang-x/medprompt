## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the scenario, let's break down the key points:

1. **Patient's condition**: The patient is a 59-year-old male who underwent sigmoidectomy for recurrent diverticulitis and has anemia post-operatively.
2. **Symptoms**: The patient complains of chills after being paged to the bedside with a temperature of 38.7 C, despite having been on a fever-reducing medication (acetaminophen) as per his order.
3. **Lab results**: The patient's hemoglobin is low at 5.9 g/dL, indicating anemia, and he has received 2 units of packed red blood cells but the transfusion was stopped immediately after.

Considering these points:

- The patient's chills are a concerning symptom that may indicate an infection or another underlying condition.
- The fact that the patient is on acetaminophen for fever reduction does not directly address the concern of chills, which suggests that there might be an infectious component to his presentation.
- The recent extensive bleeding during surgery and the need for immediate blood transfusion raise concerns about coagulopathy or other complications that could lead to a hypercoagulable state.

Given these considerations:

The best management strategy would focus on addressing the potential underlying cause of the chills, which is likely an infection. Among the options provided:

- **A. Monitor patient and administer acetaminophen**: While monitoring is crucial, administering acetaminophen does not address the suspected infectious cause.
- **B. Prescribe diphenhydramine**: Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that can be used to treat allergic reactions or itching but is not a primary treatment for infections.
- **C. Start supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula**: While supplemental oxygen may be beneficial in certain cases of infection, starting it without evidence of respiratory distress or failure is premature.
- **D. Initiate broad spectrum antibiotics**: Given the patient's symptoms (chills) and recent surgery with significant blood loss, initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics is the most appropriate management strategy to address the likely infectious cause.

Therefore, the best initial step would be to initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential bacterial infections that could be causing the chills.
