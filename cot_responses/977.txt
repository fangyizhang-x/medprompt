## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's consider the patient's condition and how it affects cardiac function.

1. **Amyloidosis**: This is a condition characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in various tissues, including the heart. In the context of cardiac amyloidosis, these fibrils can accumulate in the myocardium, leading to stiffening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy).

2. **Cardiac abnormalities secondary to amyloidosis**: The presence of amyloidosis is associated with non-rhythm-based cardiac abnormalities, which include left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiomegaly.

3. **Impact on cardiac function**:
   - **Decreased compliance**: Cardiomyopathy due to amyloidosis can lead to decreased myocardial stiffness (compliance). This means that the heart muscle becomes stiffer, making it harder for the heart to relax and fill with blood during diastole.
   - **Preserved ejection fraction**: The ejection fraction is a measure of how much blood the left ventricle pumps out with each contraction. In amyloidosis, the condition can lead to cardiomyopathy that may not significantly impair the heart's ability to eject blood (ejection fraction remains relatively preserved).

Considering these points:

- **Option A** (Preserved ejection fraction and decreased compliance) is incorrect because while ejection fraction might be preserved, the heart muscle becomes stiff due to amyloidosis, leading to decreased compliance.
  
- **Option B** (Decreased ejection fraction and increased compliance) is incorrect for similar reasons as option A; the ejection fraction remains relatively preserved.

- **Option C** (Decreased ejection fraction and decreased compliance) aligns with our understanding of how amyloidosis affects cardiac function. The stiffening of the heart muscle due to cardiomyopathy leads to a decrease in the heart's ability to eject blood, while simultaneously increasing its stiffness, making it harder for the heart to relax and fill.

- **Option D** (Increased ejection fraction and decreased compliance) is incorrect because an increased ejection fraction would be expected if the heart muscle were able to pump more blood out with each contraction, not less due to cardiomyopathy.

Therefore, the answer is C.
