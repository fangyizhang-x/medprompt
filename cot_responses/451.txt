## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The question describes a newborn with a cleft lip, which is typically associated with abnormalities in the formation of facial structures during embryonic development.

Firstly, let's consider the options provided:

A. Failure of development of the first pharyngeal arch - The first pharyngeal arch (mandibular arch) contributes to the formation of several structures, including the jaw and the muscles of mastication. However, it is not directly associated with the formation of facial features such as a cleft lip.

B. Failure of fusion of the left maxillary prominence and the medial nasal process of the frontonasal prominence - The maxillary prominences are crucial for the development of the upper jaw and palate. The medial nasal process contributes to the formation of the nose. A failure in their fusion is indeed associated with cleft lip and palate, as seen in this case.

C. Partial resorption of the first pharyngeal arch - This option does not accurately describe a known embryological process related to facial development.

D. Failure of development of the left maxillary prominence - While it's true that the left side is affected, the specific issue here appears to be with the fusion of structures rather than their developmental failure.

Given this analysis, the most accurate explanation for the abnormality described in the question is the failure of fusion of the left maxillary prominence and the medial nasal process of the frontonasal prominence. This would lead to a cleft lip on the left side as seen in this case.

Therefore, the answer is B.
