## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Firstly, let's understand the context and the process involved.

Gamete production (oogenesis) is a complex process involving multiple stages, including primary oocyte development, meiosis, and fertilization. The question specifically asks about the phases of meiosis that primary oocytes and secondary oocytes are arrested in at different times relative to ovulation and fertilization.

Primary oocytes are arrested in prophase I of meiosis until they reach metaphase II, when they are ready for fertilization. Secondary oocytes, on the other hand, are arrested in metaphase II of meiosis until they undergo ovulation.

Given this understanding:

- Primary oocytes are arrested in prophase I.
- Secondary oocytes are arrested in metaphase II.

Therefore, the answer is A. Metaphase I; metaphase II.
