## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's consider the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Positron Emission Tomography (PET) indicates a malignant nodule**: PET scans are often used to identify areas of high metabolic activity in the body, which can be indicative of cancer. A malignant nodule on PET would suggest that the nodule is likely to be cancerous.

2. **Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy is performed**: Bronchoscopy allows for direct visualization and sampling of the airways and lung tissue. Transbronchial biopsy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube (bronchoscope) through the mouth or nose into one of the larger airways to collect tissue samples from the lung tissue.

3. **Frozen section analysis is performed on the specimen sample**: Frozen section analysis is a rapid diagnostic procedure that involves freezing the tissue sample and then examining it under a microscope before it has been fixed in formalin. This allows for immediate assessment of the tissue's architecture and cellular composition, which can help identify the type of cancer.

Given these steps, let's consider the options:

- **A. Large cell carcinoma**: While large cell carcinomas are aggressive types of lung cancer, they are not as commonly identified through frozen section analysis in this context.
  
- **B. Carcinoid tumor**: Carcinoid tumors are typically slow-growing and can be found in various parts of the body, including the lungs. However, they are less likely to be identified through a transbronchial biopsy due to their slower growth rate.

- **C. Squamous cell carcinoma**: This is one of the most common types of lung cancer, especially in non-smokers. It originates from the squamous cells lining the airways and can often be identified through bronchoscopy with frozen section analysis.

- **D. Metastasis of colorectal cancer**: While metastatic disease to the lungs can occur, a malignant nodule on PET would more likely indicate an initial primary lung tumor rather than metastatic disease from another site like the colon.

Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis for the specimen sample sent through frozen section analysis is **C. Squamous cell carcinoma**, given its common occurrence in non-smokers and its typical presentation as a malignant nodule on PET scans.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
