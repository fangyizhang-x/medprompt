## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's identify the given information:

- Total patients = 200
- Controls = 100 (half of 200)
- Exposed patients in trial arm = 30%
- Patients with bacterial meningitis in exposed group = 70% of 30% = 0.7 * 0.3 = 0.21
- Patients without bacterial meningitis in unexposed group = 1%

We need to calculate the relative risk (RR) due to disease exposure.

Relative Risk is defined as the ratio of the probability of an event occurring in the exposed group versus a non-exposed group.

Let's denote:
- P(exposed) as the probability of developing bacterial meningitis in the exposed group
- P(non-exposed) as the probability of not developing bacterial meningitis in the unexposed group

Given that 30% of patients are exposed, we can calculate P(exposed):

P(exposed) = 0.3 (since 30% of 200 is 60)

Now, let's calculate the relative risk:

RR = P(exposed) / P(non-exposed)
= 0.21 / 0.01
= 21

To express this as a ratio of probabilities, we can use the formula for relative risk in terms of proportions (or percentages):

RR = (P(exposed) / P(non-exposed)) = (30% / 1%) = 3%

However, to match the format of the answer choices, let's re-express it using the given options:

RR = [0.21 / 0.01] / [1 / (1 + 99)]
= [0.21 / 0.01] / [1 / (100 + 99)]
= [0.21 / 0.01] / [1 / 199]
= 21 / 1/199
= 21 * 199
= 4149

Therefore, the answer is D.
