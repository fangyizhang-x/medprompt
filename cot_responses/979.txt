## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of acute onset dyspnea and hemoptysis in a 68-year-old female with a large perfusion defect on ventilation-perfusion scan, without prior history of surgeries or significant past medical history, we can deduce that the patient likely has pulmonary embolism (PE). The key points to consider are:

1. **Acute onset dyspnea and hemoptysis**: These symptoms suggest a sudden obstruction in the airways or lungs.
2. **Large perfusion defect on ventilation-perfusion scan**: This indicates that there is an area of lung tissue being poorly ventilated but still receiving blood flow, which is characteristic of a pulmonary embolism.

Considering these points, we can expect the patient to have several symptoms and signs associated with PE:

- **Pleuritic chest pain (A)**: This type of pain is typically associated with pleurisy, inflammation of the lining surrounding the lungs. While it's possible in some cases of PE, it's not as directly related to the perfusion defect on ventilation-perfusion scan.

- **Bradycardia (B)**: Bradycardia can occur due to the body's response to pain and stress, but it's not a specific finding that would be expected in this scenario.

- **Aortic dilation (C)**: This is more commonly associated with conditions like aortic dissection or aneurysm. While PE can cause various complications, aortic dilation is not a direct consequence of the perfusion defect on ventilation-perfusion scan.

- **Claudication (D)**: Claudication refers to pain in the legs or arms that occurs during walking due to inadequate blood flow. Given the patient's symptoms of acute onset dyspnea and hemoptysis, which suggest an obstruction in the airways or lungs, claudication is a likely finding. The perfusion defect on ventilation-perfusion scan indicates that there is reduced blood flow to the lung tissue, leading to ischemia and subsequent pain.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D. Claudication.
