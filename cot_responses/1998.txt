## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 10-month-old boy, it is essential to consider the possibility of a congenital heart condition that could be contributing to his episodes of apnea (pauses in breathing) when frightened or upset.

The key points from the history and physical examination are:

1. Normal development and progression of physical milestones.
2. Episodes of apnea lasting 20-30 seconds, accompanied by cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the lips and face).
3. Normal resumption of breathing within 45 seconds after the episode.

Considering these points, a high index of suspicion for a congenital heart condition should be raised. The most common conditions that could cause such symptoms in this age group include:

1. Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), which is characterized by four components: ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta.
2. Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS), which involves underdevelopment of the left side of the heart.

Given these considerations, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. Education and reassurance of the mother: While it is essential to educate the mother about her child's condition and provide reassurance, this approach may not be sufficient in addressing the underlying issue.

B. Echocardiogram: An echocardiogram can help identify structural abnormalities in the heart that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms. It is a non-invasive test that can provide valuable information about the child's cardiac function and anatomy.

C. Electroencephalogram (EEG): An EEG is used to evaluate the electrical activity of the brain. While it may be useful in certain cases, it is not directly relevant to this patient's symptoms.

D. Basic metabolic panel: A basic metabolic panel can provide information about the child's electrolyte levels and other laboratory parameters. However, it is not a diagnostic test for congenital heart conditions.

Based on the clinical presentation and the need to investigate potential underlying cardiac causes, an echocardiogram would be the most appropriate initial management step.

The final answer is: B
