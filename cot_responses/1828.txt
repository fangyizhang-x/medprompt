Given the patient's presentation of right-sided weakness and slurring of speech, along with facial asymmetry and reduced muscle strength on one side, this is suggestive of a stroke. The presence of hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, and significant smoking history increase the risk for ischemic stroke.

The CT scan findings are not explicitly described in the question, but based on the symptoms and patient's presentation, it is likely that there is an acute ischemic stroke affecting the right hemisphere of the brain.

Considering the patient's medical history, the most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate anticoagulation therapy to prevent further clot formation. This is because atrial fibrillation significantly increases the risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke.

Option B (Heparin) is the correct choice for this scenario. Heparin is a standard anticoagulant used to prevent and treat thrombosis in patients with atrial fibrillation. It is often started at a low dose and gradually increased as necessary to achieve adequate anticoagulation.

Aspirin (Option A) may also be considered, but it is not the first-line treatment for acute ischemic stroke due to its antiplatelet effects which can actually increase the risk of bleeding in this context. Metoprolol (Option C) is a beta-blocker that may be used to manage hypertension and reduce the risk of stroke, but it is not the primary treatment for acute ischemic stroke.

Tissue plasminogen activator (Option D) is a thrombolytic agent used to treat acute ischemic stroke within a specific time window after symptom onset. However, its use is typically reserved for patients who meet specific criteria and have a high likelihood of benefit from early treatment.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in managing this patient with suspected acute ischemic stroke due to atrial fibrillation would be to initiate anticoagulation therapy with heparin.
