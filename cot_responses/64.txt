Given the patient's symptoms of "pins and needles" in both arms, particularly along the posterior forearms, and considering his recent ACL tear, we can deduce that the paresthesias are likely related to nerve compression or irritation. The location of the paresthesias (posterior forearms) suggests involvement of the radial nerve.

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is a significant injury but does not directly explain the posterior forearm paresthesias. However, it's essential to consider that the ACL can be affected by swelling or irritation in the knee area, which might indirectly affect nearby nerves.

A key point to note is that the radial nerve runs close to the humerus (upper arm bone) and the brachial plexus, a complex network of nerves that originates in the neck and spinal cord. The brachial plexus can be compressed or irritated by swelling or inflammation in the shoulder or upper arm area.

Considering these factors:

- Loss of arm abduction (A) is not directly related to the symptoms described.
- Loss of finger abduction (B) would more likely affect the ulnar nerve, which runs down the inside of the forearm and arm.
- Loss of forearm flexion and supination (C) could be related to issues with the brachial plexus or the musculocutaneous nerve, but it's less directly linked to the symptoms described.
- Loss of wrist extension (D) is a function primarily controlled by the radial nerve. The radial nerve innervates muscles that control wrist and finger extension.

Therefore, given the location of the paresthesias along the posterior forearms and considering the recent ACL tear, the most likely physical examination finding would be loss of wrist extension (D), as this would directly affect the function controlled by the radial nerve.
