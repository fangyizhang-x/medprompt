## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To answer this question, let's break down the key concepts and relationships involved.

1. **Understanding the context**: The patient is started on daily administration of sildenafil for erectile dysfunction (ED). Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, which is commonly used to treat ED by increasing blood flow to the penis.

2. **Mechanism of action of sildenafil**: Sildenafil works by inhibiting the enzyme PDE5, which breaks down cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP is a key intracellular mediator involved in smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.

3. **Relationship between sildenafil and cGMP**: Since sildenafil inhibits PDE5, it increases the levels of cGMP within the target tissues, including the corpus cavernosum of the penis. This increase in cGMP leads to smooth muscle relaxation, increased blood flow, and ultimately, an erection.

4. **Eliminating incorrect options**:
   - A. Ca2+ (Calcium ions) are involved in various cellular processes, but they are not directly accumulated as a result of sildenafil's action.
   - C. AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) is another intracellular molecule that can be affected by various drugs, but it is not the primary mediator accumulated due to sildenafil's action.
   - D. ANP (Atrial natriuretic peptide) is involved in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance, but it is not directly related to sildenafil's mechanism of action.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the understanding of sildenafil's mechanism of action and its effects on intracellular mediators, the correct answer is B. cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate).

Therefore, the answer is B.
