## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's consider the key features and differential diagnoses for a 5-year-old boy presenting with fever, pain, swelling in the left leg, and limping.

1. **Age and Presentation**: The patient is a young child, which raises the possibility of certain bone tumors that are more common in children.
2. **Symptoms**: Fever, pain, swelling, and limping suggest an inflammatory or infectious process affecting the bone.
3. **Vital Signs**: Tachycardia (elevated heart rate) and fever further support the presence of an infection or inflammation.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Mixed lytic and blastic appearance in the X-ray**:
   - This description is more typical of osteosarcoma, a primary bone malignancy that often presents with aggressive bone destruction (lytic lesions) and sometimes with a blastic component.
   - While Ewing's sarcoma can cause lytic bone lesions, it typically presents with a mix of both lytic and blastic components.

B. **X-ray showing lytic bone lesion with periosteal reaction**:
   - This is the most suggestive finding for Ewing's sarcoma. The presence of a lytic (destructive) lesion with periosteal reaction (a new layer of bone forming around the lesion) is highly characteristic of this tumor.
   - Periosteal reaction is a common feature in Ewing's sarcoma, which often leads to the formation of a "pencil-in-cup" appearance on X-ray.

C. **X-ray showing broad-based projections from the surface of the bone**:
   - This description could be consistent with several conditions, including osteosarcoma or giant cell tumor of bone.
   - However, it is less specific for Ewing's sarcoma compared to option B.

D. **X-ray showing deep muscle plane displacement from the metaphysis**:
   - This finding can be seen in various conditions, including osteomyelitis (infection of the bone) or certain types of bone tumors.
   - While it could suggest a destructive process affecting the bone, it is not as specific for Ewing's sarcoma.

Considering these points, the most suggestive X-ray finding for Ewingâ€™s sarcoma is option B: **X-ray showing lytic bone lesion with periosteal reaction**.
