## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the presentation of puffy eyes in an otherwise healthy 8-year-old boy, along with a positive urinalysis for red blood cells and an amber urine sample, we can deduce that the patient likely has a condition affecting the kidneys or urinary tract. The key findings here are:

1. **Puffy eyes (periorbital edema)**: This suggests fluid retention or increased pressure in the body's vascular system.
2. **Red blood cells in the urine**: This indicates kidney damage or disease, as red blood cells can leak into the urine due to impaired kidney function.

Considering these findings, we need to evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Autoimmune type IV collagen destruction**: This is associated with conditions like lupus nephritis, which typically presents with more severe symptoms such as hematuria (blood in the urine), proteinuria (protein in the urine), and often a higher level of serum creatinine.

B. **Deposition of circulating immune complexes**: This is characteristic of conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis, which can cause kidney inflammation and damage. However, SLE typically presents with more widespread symptoms including fever, joint pain, and skin rashes.

C. **IgA-mediated vasculitis**: This condition, also known as IgA nephropathy, is the most common cause of kidney disease worldwide. It often presents with hematuria (blood in the urine) and proteinuria, which fits the patient's presentation. The positive urinalysis for red blood cells further supports this diagnosis.

D. **IgE-mediated degranulation**: This would be more indicative of allergic reactions or conditions like allergic interstitial nephritis, which typically presents with acute kidney injury (AKI) rather than chronic kidney disease as seen in this patient.

Given the information provided and the typical presentations of these conditions, the most likely etiology of this patient's symptoms is IgA-mediated vasculitis, specifically IgA nephropathy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
