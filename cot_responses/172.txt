## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To address this question, let's break down the key points and analyze each option step by step:

1. **Understanding Glucose Transporters**: The question mentions that certain glucose transporters are expressed predominantly on skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes. This implies we're dealing with specific types of glucose transporters (e.g., GLUT4 in skeletal muscle, GLUT3 in adipocytes) that have unique characteristics.

2. **Role of Insulin**: Insulin is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells. However, its direct effect on increasing glucose uptake in specific cell types (like skeletal muscle and adipocytes) without affecting other cell types is limited.

3. **Analyzing Options**:
   - A. **Increased levels of circulating insulin**: Insulin's primary role is to increase blood glucose levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells, not specifically targeting skeletal muscle or adipocytes.
   - B. **Increased plasma glucose concentration**: This option suggests a direct effect on glucose levels in the bloodstream, which aligns with how insulin works but doesn't directly address selective increase in specific cell types.
   - C. **Decreased plasma glucose concentration**: This would actually decrease blood glucose levels, which is counterintuitive to the purpose of insulin and glucose transporters.
   - D. **It is physiologically impossible to selectively increase glucose uptake in specific cells**: This option acknowledges that insulin's primary action is not specifically targeting skeletal muscle or adipocytes but suggests a theoretical impossibility based on current understanding.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the above analysis, the most logical answer is D. It is physiologically impossible to selectively increase glucose uptake in specific cells without affecting other cell types. This aligns with our understanding of insulin's role and the characteristics of glucose transporters expressed on skeletal muscle and adipocytes.

Therefore, the answer is D.
