(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the scenario, let's break down the key points:

1. **Sudden leakage of clear vaginal fluid at 32 weeks' gestation**: This suggests preterm labor or a condition that could potentially lead to preterm birth if not managed promptly.

2. **No history of serious illness and no current medications that could cause uterine contractions**: This reduces the likelihood of certain complications, but it doesn't rule out others.

3. **Clear fluid in the cervical canal on speculum examination**: This is a key finding indicating preterm labor or a similar condition.

4. **Fetal heart rate is reactive at 160/min with no decelerations and uterine contractions are present**: These findings support the diagnosis of preterm labor, as they indicate fetal distress due to uterine contractions.

5. **Nitrazine testing is positive**: This test is used to assess the risk of preterm birth by measuring the amount of amniotic fluid that can be expected in a normal pregnancy. A positive result indicates an increased risk of preterm labor, which aligns with this patient's presentation.

6. **Indomethacin administration**: Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to induce preterm labor by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, which can lead to uterine contractions and cervical ripening.

Considering the above points:

- Option A (Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with cesarean section) is not indicated as there's no clear indication of preterm labor requiring immediate delivery or induction. Betamethasone is typically given to promote fetal lung maturity in cases where preterm birth is anticipated.

- Option B (Administer ampicillin and perform amnioinfusion) might be considered if there were concerns about infection, but the positive nitrazine test does not directly indicate an increased risk of infection.

- Option C (Administer betamethasone and ampicillin) aligns with current guidelines for managing preterm labor. Betamethasone is recommended to promote fetal lung maturity, and ampicillin can be used to prevent neonatal sepsis if there's a concern about maternal or fetal infection.

- Option D (Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with induction of labor) might seem like a comprehensive approach but
