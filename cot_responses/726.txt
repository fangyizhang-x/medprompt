## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including the recent onset of vomiting after meals, frequent and forceful vomiting despite attempts to position him during mealtimes and formula changes, dark yellow urine, failure to thrive (falling one standard deviation off his growth curve), and signs of dehydration (low blood pressure, tachycardia, tachypnea, and dry skin), the most likely diagnosis is a condition known as pyloric stenosis.

Pyloric stenosis is a motility disorder of the stomach where the muscle around the opening of the stomach (the pylorus) thickens, leading to obstruction of food passage. This can cause projectile vomiting, which in this case has been increasing in frequency and forcefulness despite attempts at management.

The best next step in management for a patient with suspected pyloric stenosis is an abdominal ultrasound. This imaging test can help confirm the diagnosis by showing the thickened pylorus and other signs of obstruction. It is non-invasive, quick, and does not expose the patient to radiation or contrast agents, making it a safe option.

Intravenous hydration (B) may be necessary if the patient is severely dehydrated but is not immediately indicated as the first step in management. Pyloromyotomy (C) is a surgical procedure that involves cutting the thickened pylorus to relieve obstruction and is typically considered after an ultrasound has confirmed the diagnosis and the patient's symptoms have improved with medical management.

Thickening feeds (D) may be recommended for some patients, but it is not the best next step in management. Thickening feeds can help manage symptoms by providing a more palatable and easier-to-digest diet, but they do not address the underlying cause of the obstruction.

Therefore, the best next step in management is to perform an abdominal ultrasound (A) to confirm the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis and guide further treatment decisions.
