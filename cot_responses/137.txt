## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The observed weight gain in the experimental group can be explained by the increased secretion and action of ghrelin, a hormone produced in the gastrointestinal tract that stimulates appetite and increases food intake.

Ghrelin is released from the stomach and sent to the hypothalamus, where it binds to receptors that stimulate the release of other hormones involved in energy homeostasis. One such hormone is leptin, which suppresses appetite and decreases food intake.

In the experimental group, the daily injection with a synthetic analog of ghrelin would likely increase the levels of ghrelin in the bloodstream, leading to increased stimulation of the hypothalamus. This, in turn, would result in an increase in appetite and food intake, causing the mice to eat more and gain significantly more weight.

The other options are not directly related to the observed weight gain:

A. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that stimulates digestion and increases satiety after eating, but it does not stimulate appetite or food intake in response to ghrelin.

B. Somatostatin inhibits the release of several hormones, including ghrelin, from the hypothalamus, which would actually decrease appetite and weight gain.

D. Glucagon stimulates the liver to produce glucose, which is stored as glycogen and released into the bloodstream when blood glucose levels are low. It does not directly influence food intake or weight gain in response to ghrelin.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the observed weight gain in the experimental group is the stimulation of ghrelin by the synthetic analog, leading to increased appetite and food intake.
