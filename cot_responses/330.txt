To determine the tumor grade in this patient, we need to consider the characteristics of the polygonal clear cells filled with lipids that are seen on the biopsy of the renal mass.

Firstly, the presence of polygonal clear cells filled with lipids is highly suggestive of a clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRC), which is a type of kidney cancer. Clear cell carcinomas are known for their distinctive histological features, including the accumulation of lipid droplets within the tumor cells.

The size of malignant proliferation (A) is an important factor in determining the tumor grade, as larger tumors tend to have higher grades and worse prognosis. However, this information alone would not be sufficient to determine the tumor grade.

The degree of mitotic activity (B) can also provide some insight into the tumor's aggressiveness, but it is not a reliable indicator of tumor grade. Mitotic activity can vary widely among different types of tumors, including CCRCs.

The response to chemotherapy (C) may be an important factor in determining prognosis and treatment planning, but it is not directly related to determining the tumor grade.

Involvement of regional lymph nodes (D) is a critical factor in determining the tumor's stage and ultimately its prognosis. The presence or absence of lymph node involvement can significantly impact the patient's outcome, as CCRCs are often associated with a poorer prognosis compared to other types of kidney cancer.

Therefore, the necessary feature to determine the tumor grade in this patient is the involvement of regional lymph nodes (D).
