## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 2-year-old boy, we can deduce that he has a scald wound infection, which is typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. The presence of fever (40.2°C or 104.4°F), elevated white blood cell count (13,900/mm3), and purulent discharge from the wound are indicative of a bacterial infection.

The patient's symptoms, such as discomfort but not acute distress, and the absence of other medical conditions, suggest that he is not in immediate need for surgical intervention or aggressive fluid resuscitation. The examination findings also support this diagnosis, with uneven, asymmetrical scalding covering his anterior torso in arrow-like patterns.

Considering the severity of the wound and the potential for bacterial contamination, we need to choose an antibiotic regimen that covers both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Let's evaluate the options:

A. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone: This combination is effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including S. aureus and some Gram-negative organisms like E. coli.

B. Piperacillin/tazobactam and cefepime: While piperacillin/tazobactam has broad-spectrum activity, cefepime's coverage might not be as comprehensive as needed for this scenario.

C. Vancomycin and metronidazole: Vancomycin is effective against S. aureus and some Gram-positive bacteria, but it lacks coverage against many Gram-negative organisms like E. coli. Metronidazole has limited activity against anaerobic bacteria, which are also potential pathogens in this case.

D. Vancomycin and cefepime: This combination provides broad-spectrum coverage, including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, making it the most appropriate initial pharmacological treatment for this patient.

Therefore, considering the need for a comprehensive antibiotic regimen that covers both S. aureus and potential Gram-negative organisms, option D is the best choice.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
