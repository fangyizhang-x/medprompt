## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation and biopsy results, we can deduce that the patient has a malignant tumor, likely a leiomyosarcoma given the location (distal thigh) and histological features (pleomorphic smooth muscle cells with nuclear atypia). The key to answering this question lies in understanding the immunohistochemical characteristics of leiomyosarcomas.

Leiomyosarcomas are known to express certain proteins that can help identify them on biopsy. Let's evaluate each option:

A. Chromogranin: This protein is typically associated with neuroendocrine tumors, such as carcinoids or medullary thyroid carcinoma. It's not a primary marker for leiomyosarcoma.

B. Desmin: While desmin is a muscle-specific protein, it's more commonly associated with smooth muscle tumors like leiomyomas rather than sarcomas.

C. Cytokeratin: This is a general epithelial marker that can be positive in various types of carcinomas and sarcomas. However, cytokeratins are not specific for leiomyosarcoma.

D. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP): GFAP is an intermediate filament protein typically expressed in astrocytes and other glial cells. It's also commonly used as a marker for glioblastoma, which can sometimes be confused with leiomyosarcomas due to their similar histological appearance.

Given the clinical context and biopsy results, the most likely tumor type is a leiomyosarcoma, which would express GFAP. Therefore, the patient's tumor will most strongly stain for Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).

The final answer is: D
