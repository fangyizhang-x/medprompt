## Step 1: Analyzing the symptoms and physical examination findings
The patient presents with difficulty walking, foot dragging while walking, tiredness, diffuse wheezing over bilateral lung fields on auscultation, tender subcutaneous nodules on the elbows and shins, impaired dorsiflexion of the right foot, decreased sensation to pinprick, light touch, and vibration in the ulnar aspect of the left forearm, and elevated erythematous lesions on both shins. These findings suggest a systemic condition affecting multiple organ systems.

## Step 2: Considering the laboratory studies
The patient has an elevated leukocyte count with a predominance of segmented neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets. The serum urea nitrogen is slightly elevated, indicating mild renal impairment, while the creatinine level is slightly elevated, suggesting some degree of renal involvement.

## Step 3: Evaluating the differential diagnoses
Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, we can evaluate the potential diagnoses:
- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a vasculitic condition that can cause renal failure, lung disease, and skin lesions.
- Goodpasture syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, which does not match this patient's laboratory findings.
- Excessive glucocorticoid use could lead to various systemic effects but would not typically present with the specific combination of symptoms and physical examination findings seen in this patient.
- Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome) is a condition that can cause asthma, eosinophilia, and vasculitis affecting multiple organ systems.

## Step 4: Making a diagnosis
Considering the combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, laboratory results, and the patient's history of chronic sinusitis and asthma, Churg-Strauss syndrome (now more commonly referred to as Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) is the most likely diagnosis. This condition is characterized by eosinophilia, asthma, and vasculitis affecting multiple organ systems.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
