## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the information provided, let's analyze each option step by step:

A. **The number of patients on his panel**: While having a large patient panel might contribute to feelings of burnout or increased stress due to managing multiple cases simultaneously, it is less directly linked to the specific symptoms described (tiredness and wrong prescriptions) compared to other factors.

B. **Excessive bureaucratic tasks**: This option seems more relevant as excessive administrative burdens can lead to feelings of frustration, which might contribute to burnout. However, there's no direct link between bureaucratic tasks and the specific issues mentioned in the question (tiredness and wrong prescriptions).

C. **Working too many hours**: Working long hours is a well-documented contributor to physician burnout and decreased job satisfaction. The fact that the physician spends 51 hours per week visiting patients daily suggests he might be working excessively, which could lead to feelings of exhaustion.

D. **Concern over online reputation**: While concerns about online reputation can contribute to stress for physicians, it is less directly linked to the specific symptoms described (tiredness and wrong prescriptions) compared to other factors like excessive work hours or bureaucratic tasks.

Considering these points, the most likely contributor to the physician's current condition (feeling tired and experiencing wrong prescriptions) seems to be **C. Working too many hours**, as it directly relates to his reported workload and is a well-documented factor contributing to burnout among physicians.

The final answer is: C
