Given the acute onset and progressive worsening of symptoms in a 16-year-old girl, along with physical examination findings such as anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, edema of the oropharynx, and tonsillar swelling without exudate, the most likely diagnosis is streptococcal pharyngitis. The presence of these symptoms and signs suggests an acute bacterial infection.

The rapid strep test (A) is a quick and accurate diagnostic tool for identifying streptococcal pharyngitis. It can be performed on throat swabs and provides immediate results, which is crucial in the management of this condition as it allows for prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy if the patient is indeed infected with Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS).

In contrast, ultrasound of the anterior cervical lymph nodes (B) may be useful in evaluating lymphadenopathy but is not the immediate next step in management. Empiric treatment with antibiotics (C) might be considered if a rapid strep test is negative or inconclusive, but it should not delay the initiation of antibiotic therapy until results are available.

Empiric treatment with antivirals (D) is not indicated for streptococcal pharyngitis as there is no evidence to suggest that this condition is caused by a viral infection. The standard treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis involves antibiotics, and antiviral medications are reserved for specific cases of acute rheumatic fever or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform a rapid strep test to confirm the diagnosis before initiating antibiotic therapy.
