## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, let's break down the key points:

1. **Normal menstrual cycle and symptoms**: The patient has a regular 28-day menstrual cycle, normal flow, and last menstrual period (LMP) 20 days ago. This suggests that her reproductive system is functioning normally.
2. **Inconsistent condom use**: Although she uses condoms inconsistently, this may not be the primary concern given the negative Pap smear result.
3. **Family history of breast cancer**: The patient's sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40, which increases her risk for breast cancer. However, the patient's age (36) and family history are within the normal range for breast cancer risk.
4. **Lifestyle factors**: She drinks wine occasionally and smokes cigarettes daily, but these habits do not appear to be significantly impacting her reproductive health.

Considering these points, the most likely cause of the atypical glandular cells (AGC) seen on the Pap smear is an abnormal cell change that could be related to hormonal influences or other factors. Given the patient's age and family history, we should consider the possibility of a benign condition rather than cancer.

**Option A: Repeat cervical cytology at 12 months** - This option may not be necessary given the normal findings on the initial Pap smear and the lack of symptoms that would necessitate further evaluation.

**Option B: Perform colposcopy with endocervical and endometrial sampling** - While a colposcopy is a useful diagnostic tool, it does not provide direct evidence for or against cancer. The patient's family history of breast cancer makes this option less likely.

**Option C: Perform a diagnostic loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP)** - LEEP is a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure that can be used to remove abnormal cells from the cervix. However, it may not provide sufficient tissue for diagnosis in cases where the AGC are atypical.

**Option D: Perform colposcopy with endocervical sampling** - This option combines a colposcopy with an endocervical biopsy, which is more informative than a single colposcopy and can provide direct evidence of any abnormality. Given the patient's age and family history, this option seems to be the most appropriate next step in management.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
