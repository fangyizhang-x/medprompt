(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To establish lactation, several factors are involved in the process, including hormonal changes that stimulate milk production and release. The primary hormone responsible for this process is prolactin.

Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that plays a crucial role in lactation. It stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk, which is essential for feeding the newborn. In the context of breastfeeding, prolactin levels increase significantly after delivery and continue to rise until about 6 weeks postpartum.

The other options are not directly involved in establishing lactation:

- Thyrotropes (A) are responsible for regulating thyroid hormone production and have no direct role in lactation.
- Lactotropes (B) are a type of cell that produces milk, but they are not the primary hormone responsible for establishing lactation. They are present in the mammary glands from birth and continue to produce milk throughout life.
- Corticotropes (C) are involved in the production of cortisol, a hormone associated with stress response, and have no direct role in lactation.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Lactotropes.
