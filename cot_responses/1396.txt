To address this question, we need to consider the factors that could potentially contraindicate breastfeeding in a newborn.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option:

A. Ranitidine use: While ranitidine is an antihistamine used for its anti-ulcer properties and can be associated with neonatal hypoglycemia, there isn't a direct contraindication to breastfeeding based on ranitidine use alone.

B. Hepatitis B infection: Hepatitis B is a significant concern because it can be transmitted from mother to child during birth if the mother has an active infection. However, hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all newborns, and the risk of transmission through breastfeeding is considered low if the mother is on effective antiviral therapy.

C. Seropositive for cytomegalovirus (CMV): CMV is a viral infection that can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or childbirth. However, CMV infection in newborns is usually asymptomatic and does not significantly impact breastfeeding outcomes.

D. Cannabis use: Cannabis use by the mother could potentially affect milk production or quality, but there isn't a well-established contraindication for breastfeeding based on cannabis use alone.

Given these considerations, the most significant concern that directly affects breastfeeding in this scenario would be hepatitis B infection (B), as it can pose a risk to the newborn's health if transmitted through breast milk. However, it is essential to note that with proper antiviral therapy and vaccination, the risk of transmission is minimized.

Therefore, the answer is B.
