## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's define what we're trying to find: the relative risk (RR) of MRSA colonization in relation to working in the intensive-care unit (ICU).

The relative risk is a measure of the ratio of the probability of an event occurring in the exposed group versus the non-exposed group. In this case, we want to compare the probability of MRSA colonization among ICU workers with that of non-ICU workers.

We have two groups: those who worked in the ICU (n = 350) and those who did not (n = 250). We also have two subgroups within these groups: those who worked in ICUs (n = 100) and those who did not (n = 300).

To calculate the relative risk, we need to compare the odds of MRSA colonization among ICU workers with those among non-ICU workers. This can be done using the following formula:

RR = (Odds of ICU workers / Odds of non-ICU workers)

First, let's calculate the odds for each group:

For ICU workers:
Odds = Number of colonized workers / Number of non-colonized workers
= 350 / 250
= 1.4

For non-ICU workers:
Odds = Number of non-colonized workers / Number of colonized workers
= 300 / 100
= 3

Now, we can calculate the relative risk:

RR = Odds of ICU workers / Odds of non-ICU workers
= 1.4 / 3
= 0.4667 (or approximately 46.67%)

However, this is not among our answer choices. Let's re-examine our calculation.

We made a mistake in calculating the odds for non-ICU workers. The correct calculation should be:

Odds = Number of colonized workers / Number of non-colonized workers
= 100 / 300
= 0.3333

Now, we can calculate the relative risk again:

RR = Odds of ICU workers / Odds of non-ICU workers
= 1.4 / 0.3333
= 4.2 (approximately)

This is still not among our answer choices. Let's re-examine our calculation again.

We made another mistake in calculating the odds for non-ICU workers. The correct calculation should be:

Odds = Number of colon
