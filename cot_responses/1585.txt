To answer this question, let's consider the purpose and mechanism of action of the vaccine.

1. **Understanding the Vaccine**: The vaccine in question is a capsular polysaccharide vaccine, which means it contains a piece (polysaccharide) of a specific bacterial cell wall that triggers an immune response without causing the disease itself.

2. **Immune Response**: When this type of vaccine is administered, it stimulates the production of antibodies by the immune system. Antibodies are proteins that recognize and bind to specific antigens (foreign substances), marking them for destruction or neutralizing their effects.

3. **Antibody Production Against Specific Organisms**: The key here is understanding which bacterial organisms produce capsular polysaccharides as part of their cell wall structure, making them resistant to phagocytosis by the immune system.

4. **Eliminating Options**:
   - A. Smallpox: This virus causes smallpox and does not have a polysaccharide capsule that would be targeted by this vaccine.
   - B. Neisseria meningitidis: While this bacterium can cause severe infections, it is not typically associated with a capsular polysaccharide vaccine.
   - D. Clostridium tetani: This bacterium causes tetanus and does not have a polysaccharide capsule.

5. **Conclusion**: The only organism that fits the description of having a capsular polysaccharide vaccine targeting its immune system is Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which produces a toxin (diphtheria toxin) as part of its cell wall structure and is targeted by this type of vaccine.

Therefore, the answer is C.
