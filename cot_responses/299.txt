## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient presents with a combination of knee and ankle symptoms, including increasing pain and swelling, episodes of pain with urination, bilateral conjunctival inflammation, and tenderness at the Achilles tendon insertion site. These symptoms are suggestive of an inflammatory condition affecting multiple joints.

1. **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Consideration**: The patient's mother has RA, which increases the likelihood of developing RA. However, RA typically presents with symmetrical polyarthritis, morning stiffness, and systemic symptoms such as fever and fatigue. While this patient does not meet all these criteria, his mother's history raises a possibility.

2. **Sexual Activity and Condom Use**: The patient is sexually active with inconsistent condom use, which increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, the ELISA test for HIV is negative, making STI-related arthritis less likely.

3. **Laboratory Findings**: The elevated leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels indicate an inflammatory process. The cloudy synovial fluid analysis with a high neutrophil count further supports the diagnosis of an inflammatory arthritis.

4. **Symptoms and Examination Findings**: The patient's symptoms, including knee and ankle pain, conjunctival inflammation, and tenderness at the Achilles tendon insertion site, are consistent with an inflammatory condition affecting multiple joints.

Considering these factors, the most likely diagnosis is **Reactive Arthritis** (also known as Reiter's Syndrome). Reactive arthritis typically follows a gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection, which in this case is not indicated. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with reactive arthritis, particularly given the presence of conjunctival inflammation, which is a hallmark of this condition.

Reactive arthritis can be caused by various bacterial infections, including Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella Typhi, or Shigella dysenteriae. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with an infection that triggered reactive arthritis.

The other options are less likely:

- **Septic Arthritis**: Typically presents as a rapidly progressive joint infection, which is not indicated in this case.
- **Lyme Arthritis**: Characterized by a distinctive "bullseye" rash, fever, and arthralgias, which are not present in this patient.
- **Syphilitic Arthritis**: A
