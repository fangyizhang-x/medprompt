Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, let's analyze the information step by step to arrive at a diagnosis.

1. **Chief Complaints and History**: The patient presents with left chest pain, productive cough with purulent sputum for 1 week, shortness of breath, and a history of influenza without follow-up. These symptoms suggest an infectious or inflammatory process affecting the lungs.

2. **Vital Signs**: The patient has tachycardia (heart rate 70/min), tachypnea (respiratory rate 22/min), fever (temperature 38.7°C or 101.7°F), and hypoxemia (SO2 80%). These findings indicate a severe respiratory infection.

3. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - **Hemoglobin and Hematocrit**: The patient has anemia, as indicated by low hemoglobin (14 mg/dL) and hematocrit (45%), which can be seen in chronic infections or inflammation.
   - **Leukocyte Count**: The elevated leukocyte count (12,000/mm3) with a predominance of neutrophils (82%) suggests a bacterial infection. Neutrophilia is often seen in acute bacterial pneumonia.
   - **Lymphocytes and Monocytes**: While lymphocytosis (an increase in lymphocytes) can be seen in various conditions, the presence of a significant number of monocytes (3%) might suggest a chronic inflammatory process or an infectious agent that causes both neutrophilic and lymphocytic responses.

4. **Chest X-ray Findings**: The chest X-ray shows alveolar infiltrates in the left base with air bronchograms, which are characteristic of pneumonia. Air bronchograms are indicative of consolidation of lung tissue due to inflammation or infection.

Considering these findings together:

- **Sarcoidosis (A)** is less likely because it typically presents with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest X-ray and does not usually cause acute respiratory symptoms.
- **Lung Cancer (C)** can present with similar symptoms but would more commonly be associated with a history of smoking or exposure to carcinogens, which the patient did not mention.
- **Tuberculosis (D)** is possible given the patient's history of influenza without follow-up and the presence of alveolar infiltrates on chest X-ray. However, tuberculosis typically presents with lower respiratory tract symptoms such
