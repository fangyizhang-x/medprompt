## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's analyze the information provided:

1. The new drug should have a higher potency than ibuprofen but the same efficacy as ibuprofen.
2. Ibuprofen is represented by curve C in the figure.

To achieve the desired therapeutic effect (dashed line Y) with the same efficacy as ibuprofen, we need to understand how potency and efficacy are related:

- Potency refers to the amount of medication needed to produce a certain effect.
- Efficacy refers to the actual effect produced by the medication.

Since the new drug should have the same efficacy as ibuprofen but higher potency, it means that more of the new drug is required to achieve the same therapeutic effect compared to ibuprofen. This implies that the curve representing the new drug should be steeper than curve C (ibuprofen's curve) but still maintain the same level of efficacy.

Given these requirements, we can infer that the new drug's curve would need to be more steep than curve C to increase potency while maintaining the same level of efficacy as ibuprofen. This means it cannot be curve B or D, which are less steep and therefore not suitable for achieving higher potency with the same efficacy as ibuprofen.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is Curve A, as it represents a steeper curve than curve C but still maintains the desired level of efficacy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$
