## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key components and their interactions:

1. **Understanding the drug mechanism**: Candoxatril works by inhibiting an endopeptidase that breaks down a vasodilatory mediator released from the heart, which improves ejection fraction and reduces sodium excretion.

2. **Identifying the target mediator**: The mediator in question is known to promote sodium excretion and improve ejection fraction. This suggests it's involved in mechanisms related to fluid balance and cardiac function.

3. **Considering the side effect of increased angiotensin II levels**: Increased angiotensin II levels can harm patients with heart failure, indicating that this mediator plays a role in cardiovascular pathophysiology.

4. **Determining the likely outcome of combining candoxatril with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**: Given that ARBs block the action of angiotensin II, using candoxatril alongside ARBs would be expected to counteract some of the beneficial effects of candoxatril on sodium excretion and ejection fraction.

5. **Analyzing the options**:
   - A. Nitric oxide: While nitric oxide is a vasodilator that can improve cardiac function, its primary action is not directly related to sodium excretion or the specific pathway targeted by candoxatril.
   - B. Leukotrienes: These are involved in inflammation and allergic responses, not directly linked to the mechanism of candoxatril or the side effect profile described.
   - C. Acetylcholine: This neurotransmitter is involved in various physiological processes but is not directly related to sodium excretion or the specific pathway targeted by candoxatril.
   - D. Natriuretic peptides: These are vasodilatory substances released from the heart that promote sodium excretion and improve ejection fraction, making them a likely candidate for increasing as a result of this drug regimen.

Given the mechanism of action of candoxatril and the side effect profile described, the most logical outcome is an increase in natriuretic peptides due to their role in promoting sodium excretion and improving cardiac function.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
