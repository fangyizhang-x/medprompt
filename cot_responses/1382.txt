## Step 1: Assess the patient's current situation
The patient is on anticoagulation therapy for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) following a pulmonary embolism (PE), with a recent history of travel to China. She has no personal history of blood clots, but her mother had a PE in the past. Her medical history includes preeclampsia, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), and hypercholesterolemia. The patient smokes cigarettes daily and consumes alcohol moderately.

## Step 2: Evaluate the impact of travel on anticoagulation therapy
Travel to China may expose the patient to new pathogens or increase her risk for certain infections, which could potentially affect her anticoagulant therapy. However, this is not a contraindication for continuing warfarin, as long as she remains asymptomatic and does not develop any signs of bleeding.

## Step 3: Assess the current INR
The patient's platelet count decreased from 182,000/mcL to 63,000/mcL after starting heparin and warfarin. Her international normalized ratio (INR) is not yet therapeutic. This indicates that her anticoagulation therapy may be too high.

## Step 4: Consider the options for adjusting anticoagulation therapy
Option A suggests continuing heparin and warfarin until INR is therapeutic for 24 hours, which may not be necessary given the patient's platelet count decrease. Option B recommends discontinuing heparin; continuing warfarin, but this does not address the potential need to adjust the INR. Option C proposes discontinuing both medications, while option D suggests continuing heparin and warfarin with vitamin K.

## Step 5: Choose the most appropriate next step
Given that the patient's platelet count decreased significantly after starting anticoagulation therapy, it is likely that her current INR is too high. Discontinuing heparin (Option C) may not be necessary if the goal is to achieve a therapeutic INR. Continuing warfarin alone (Option B) would also not address the potential need to adjust the INR. Therefore, continuing heparin and warfarin with vitamin K (Option D) seems to be the most appropriate next step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
