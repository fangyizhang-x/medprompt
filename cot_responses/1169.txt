Given the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, we can analyze the possible causes for her condition.

Firstly, the patient is experiencing headache and visual disturbances, which are symptoms that could be indicative of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The elevated blood pressure at her first-trimester prenatal visit was also a concern, but it has decreased significantly since then. However, the current presentation suggests that there may have been an increase in ICP.

The patient's laboratory findings include:

- Elevated serum creatinine level, which indicates impaired renal function.
- Proteinuria (protein negative) and hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL), suggesting kidney damage or disease.
- The presence of blood in the urine is not directly relevant to her current symptoms but could be a concern for future complications.

Considering these findings, we can rule out some options:

* Option B (Hyperperfusion of placental tissue) is unlikely as there are no specific indicators of placental dysfunction mentioned.
* Option D (Overactivation of the coagulation cascade) might be relevant in the context of preeclampsia or eclampsia, but it does not directly explain the patient's current symptoms.

The most likely primary component in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition is:

Option A (Vasogenic cerebral edema): This is a common cause of increased ICP in pregnancy. Vasogenic cerebral edema occurs when there is an increase in intracranial pressure due to various factors, including placental abruption, preeclampsia, or eclampsia. The patient's symptoms of headache and visual disturbances, along with the laboratory findings indicating impaired renal function and kidney damage, support this diagnosis.

Therefore, vasogenic cerebral edema is the most likely primary component in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition.
