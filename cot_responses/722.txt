Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, the first step in management should be to assess his cardiovascular risk factors and determine if he is a candidate for lifestyle modifications or pharmacological interventions.

The patient has coronary artery disease (CAD), essential hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a significant amount of smoking history. These conditions increase his cardiovascular risk, making it crucial to evaluate his current medications and consider potential interactions that could exacerbate his symptoms.

The patient's physical examination reveals reduced hair growth below the knee, shiny skin, and absent dorsal pedal pulses on the right side. These findings are suggestive of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is a common complication of CAD.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate initial step in management would be to assess his ankle-brachial index (ABI) to evaluate for PAD. An ABI of 0.5 or less in either leg indicates significant PAD, which may require further evaluation and potential treatment.

Option A, Graded Exercise Therapy, is a non-pharmacological approach that can help improve cardiovascular health by increasing physical activity levels. However, it may not be sufficient as an initial step given the patient's significant CAD and PAD symptoms.

Option B, Propranolol therapy, is a beta-blocker that can help reduce blood pressure and slow the progression of CAD. While it may be beneficial for some patients with hypertension, it does not address the underlying vascular disease and may not be sufficient as an initial step in management.

Option C, Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS), is typically considered for patients with severe chronic pain that has not responded to other treatments. It is not a primary treatment for PAD or CAD symptoms.

Option D, Vascular Bypass Surgery, is a more invasive procedure that may be considered for patients with severe PAD who have significant limb ischemia and are at high risk of amputation. While it can provide relief from symptoms, it is typically reserved for patients who do not respond to other treatments.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in management would be to perform an ABI test to evaluate for PAD and assess his cardiovascular risk factors. This will help determine if lifestyle modifications or pharmacological interventions are necessary to improve his symptoms and reduce his risk of further vascular events.
