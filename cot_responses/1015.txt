Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most appropriate next step in management is to consider the possibility of a musculoskeletal injury rather than a more serious condition such as cancer.

The patient's back pain has been intermittent and worsened following a fall, which could suggest a traumatic cause. The fact that he denies lower extremity weakness, loss of sensation, or other systemic symptoms makes a serious underlying malignancy less likely. Additionally, the absence of point tenderness or vertebral step-offs on physical examination does not rule out a musculoskeletal injury.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate initial management would be to recommend rest and return to activity in 1 week (Option A). This approach is supported by the fact that the patient's pain has been intermittent and localized to the L4/L5 region, which is consistent with a muscle strain or sprain. Additionally, the use of best rest and return to activity in 1 week aligns with current guidelines for managing acute musculoskeletal injuries.

Option B, exercise therapy with NSAIDs/acetaminophen, may be beneficial in reducing pain and inflammation but does not address the underlying cause of the pain. Option C, morphine as needed, is an opioid that can have significant side effects and is generally reserved for severe pain that is not responsive to other treatments. Option D, radiograph of lumbar spine, may be useful if there are concerns about a fracture or dislocation but is not necessary at this point.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's back pain is to recommend rest and return to activity in 1 week with conservative management.
