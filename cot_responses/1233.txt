## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the diagnosis of an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma, we need to consider the potential complications and risks associated with this condition.

Firstly, let's address each option:

A. Weight loss: While some patients with Cushing's syndrome (a condition caused by excess cortisol) may experience weight gain due to increased appetite, others may experience weight loss due to decreased appetite or changes in metabolism. However, weight loss is not a direct consequence of an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma.

B. Eosinophilia: This option is particularly relevant given the patient's symptoms of fatigue and recurrent respiratory infections. Cushing's syndrome can lead to eosinophilia due to increased levels of interleukin-5 (IL-5), a cytokine involved in eosinophil production. Elevated IL-5 levels can cause an overproduction of eosinophils, leading to increased inflammation and potentially exacerbating symptoms such as respiratory infections.

C. Hypoglycemia: While some patients with Cushing's syndrome may experience hypoglycemia due to decreased cortisol levels, this is not a direct consequence of an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma.

D. Pathologic fracture: This option is more relevant to the patient's physical examination findings (thinning of the skin and multiple bruises on her arms). While patients with Cushing's syndrome may be at increased risk for osteoporosis due to decreased cortisol levels, pathologic fractures are not a direct consequence of an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma.

Considering these factors, the patient is at greatest risk for eosinophilia due to the potential for elevated IL-5 levels in response to the ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma.

The final answer is: B
