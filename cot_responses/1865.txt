## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's define what prevalence means in this context: Prevalence refers to the total number of cases of a disease or condition present in a population at a given time, divided by the total number of individuals in the population.

To calculate the prevalence, we need to first calculate the incidence (the rate of new cases) and then divide it by the total population size.

Incidence = New cases / Total population
= 4 / 100
= 0.04

Prevalence = Incidence x Population size
= 0.04 x 100
= 4%

Now, let's calculate the incidence at time points 2 and 3 months:

At t = 1 month:
Incidence = New cases / Total population
= 4 / 100
= 0.04

At t = 2 months:
New cases = Incidence x Population size + Previous new cases
= 0.04 x 100 + 2
= 4 + 2
= 6

Incidence at t = 2 months = New cases / Total population
= 6 / 100
= 0.06

At t = 3 months:
New cases = Incidence x Population size + Previous new cases
= 0.06 x 100 + 5
= 6 + 5
= 11

Incidence at t = 3 months = New cases / Total population
= 11 / 100
= 0.11

Now, let's calculate the prevalence at time points 2 and 3 months:

Prevalence at t = 2 months = Incidence x Population size
= 0.06 x 100
= 6%

Prevalence at t = 3 months = Incidence x Population size
= 0.11 x 100
= 11%

Therefore, the answer is B.
