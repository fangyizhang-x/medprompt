## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Step 1: Identify the root cause of the incident
The verbal misunderstanding of the dose of phenytoin between the ordering senior resident and the receiving first-year resident during the handover of the patient is identified as the causative factor.

### Step 2: Determine the severity of the incident
This incident involves a serious error in medication administration, which can have significant consequences for the patient's safety. The fact that it was an erroneous dose of intravenous phenytoin indicates a high level of risk.

### Step 3: Choose the most appropriate management strategy
Given the severity of the incident and its potential impact on patient safety, the most appropriate management strategy is to implement Root Cause Analysis (RCA). RCA is a systematic approach that identifies the root cause of an error or event, which in this case is the verbal misunderstanding of the dose. By analyzing the incident through RCA, we can identify the underlying factors that contributed to the error and implement changes to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

### Step 4: Justify the choice
Implementing Root Cause Analysis will help to minimize the risk of similar errors by identifying the root cause of the incident and implementing corrective actions. This approach is particularly useful in high-risk environments, such as healthcare settings where patient safety is paramount.

The final answer is: C
