## Answer
To approach this question, let's analyze the given clinical scenario step by step.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The newborn presents with bluish discoloration of his lips and fingernails (cyanosis), central cyanosis on examination, a continuous machine-like murmur over the left upper sternal border, and a single S2 heart sound. These findings are suggestive of a congenital heart defect.

2. **Echocardiography Findings**: The echocardiogram shows the pulmonary artery arising from the posterior left ventricle and an aorta arising from the right ventricle with active blood flow between the right and left ventricles. This is indicative of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), where blood flows from the high-pressure aorta to the lower-pressure pulmonary artery.

3. **Understanding PDA**: A PDA typically closes spontaneously in the first few weeks of life, but in some cases, it may persist beyond this period. The persistence or recurrence of a PDA can lead to significant cyanosis and other complications if not managed properly.

4. **Considering the Options**:
   - **A. Elevated serum TSH**: This is more indicative of thyroid dysfunction rather than directly related to the congenital heart defect described.
   - **B. Prenatal phenytoin intake**: While prenatal exposure to certain medications can affect fetal development, there's no direct link between prenatal phenytoin and the specific findings in this case.
   - **C. Positive rapid plasma reagin test (RPR)**: This is a screening test for syphilis. Given the congenital heart defect described, it's plausible that the mother could have had syphilis during pregnancy, which can lead to congenital syphilis and potentially affect fetal development.
   - **D. Elevated fasting blood glucose**: While maternal diabetes can increase the risk of congenital anomalies, there's no direct link between maternal diabetes and the specific findings in this case.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the clinical presentation and echocardiography findings suggestive of a PDA, which is often associated with congenital syphilis, the most likely further evaluation of the mother would be to screen for congenital syphilis.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
