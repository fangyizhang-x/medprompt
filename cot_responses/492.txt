Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including lightheadedness upon standing and a syncopal event after taking the first dose of medication, we need to consider medications that can cause these effects.

The enlarged prostate size is consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which often requires medical management. The use of alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists (A) as a first-line treatment for BPH is well-established and commonly used in this patient population due to their efficacy and safety profile.

Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists work by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, which helps to improve urine flow. They also reduce the pressure within the prostate, making it easier to urinate. This mechanism of action is consistent with the patient's symptoms of increased urinary frequency and a weakened urinary stream.

Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists are not typically associated with lightheadedness or syncope as a side effect. Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists (B) can cause vasoconstriction, which may lead to decreased blood flow to the prostate, but they are less commonly used for BPH and have a different mechanism of action.

Non-selective alpha receptor antagonists (C) would also not be the first choice for treating BPH due to their potential side effects, including increased intraocular pressure and cardiac arrhythmias.

Selective muscarinic agonists (D) can cause urinary retention by stimulating the bladder muscle, which is opposite to what this patient is experiencing.

Therefore, the most consistent mechanism of action with the medication in question is alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist.
