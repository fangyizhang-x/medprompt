## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine the recommended screening test for this patient, let's consider the following steps:

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 50-year-old Caucasian man with no current complaints and a healthy lifestyle (no medications). He has a significant smoking history, which increases his risk for various cancers.

2. **Risk Factors**: His family history is negative for gastrointestinal disorders, but this does not directly influence the choice of screening test for colorectal cancer or other conditions.

3. **USPSTF Recommendations**: The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) provides guidelines for the screening and diagnostic testing of various health conditions in adults. For colorectal cancer screening, they recommend a combination of tests that provide early detection and can be used to monitor for changes over time.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - A. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is primarily used for prostate cancer screening, not typically recommended as the first-line screening test for colorectal cancer.
   - B. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a tumor marker that can be elevated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer. However, it's not specific to colorectal cancer and can also be elevated in other conditions, making it less ideal as the sole screening test for this patient.
   - C. Abdominal ultrasonography is used to detect abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), which are not directly related to the patient's primary concern of colorectal cancer screening.
   - D. Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for detecting colon cancer and is recommended by various professional organizations, including the USPSTF.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis above, the most appropriate screening test from the options provided that aligns with USPSTF recommendations for colorectal cancer screening in a 50-year-old man with a significant smoking history is colonoscopy.

The final answer is: D
