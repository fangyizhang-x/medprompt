## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Firstly, let's consider the role of each cell type mentioned in the question:

- Macrophages: These cells are known for their ability to engulf and digest cellular debris and pathogens, but they are not primarily involved in exocytosis or caspase activation.
- Neutrophils: While neutrophils can phagocytose bacteria and other particles, their primary function is to kill ingested microbes through mechanisms like reactive oxygen species production and phagocytosis. They are not typically associated with the process described.
- CD8+ lymphocytes (Cytotoxic T cells): These cells play a crucial role in cell-mediated immunity by directly killing infected cells or tumor cells through mechanisms such as apoptosis, which is exactly what we're observing in this scenario.
- Eosinophils: These cells are involved in combating parasites and in allergic reactions but are not primarily associated with the process of inducing caspase activation through exocytosis.

Given that CD8+ lymphocytes (C) are directly implicated in cell-mediated immunity, including the induction of apoptosis in target cells infected with viruses by releasing granule contents that activate caspases, this is the most likely type of cell responsible for the described process.

## Answer Explanation:
The question describes a scenario where mice with certain gene deletions cannot fight viral infections. The key finding is the ability of a specific cell type to induce apoptosis in target cells through exocytosis of granule contents and activation of caspases. This points towards CD8+ lymphocytes, which are known for their role in cell-mediated immunity and direct killing of infected cells.

The process described aligns with the function of cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ lymphocytes), where they can induce apoptosis in target cells through mechanisms like the release of granule contents that contain cytotoxins. This is a critical aspect of immune defense against viral infections, as it allows for targeted killing of infected cells.

The final answer is C.
