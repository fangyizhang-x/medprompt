Given the patient's symptoms, including involuntary rhythmic shaking of both hands and head nodding movements that improve with alcohol consumption, it is likely that she is experiencing essential tremor (ET), a common movement disorder characterized by tremors, often in the hands. Essential tremor typically worsens with voluntary movement and improves with rest or certain medications.

The medication of choice for treating essential tremor is beta blockers, which are effective in reducing the tremors. Beta blockers work by blocking the action of adrenaline (epinephrine) on the body's muscles, thereby reducing muscle tremors. Other options like anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines may also be considered but are not typically first-line treatments for essential tremor.

Beta blockers can be used to treat various conditions beyond essential tremor, including hypertension, angina pectoris, glaucoma, and certain types of migraines. They are often prescribed off-label for other conditions due to their side effect profile and effectiveness in reducing symptoms.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms is beta blockers, which can also be recommended for the treatment of hypertension (D).
