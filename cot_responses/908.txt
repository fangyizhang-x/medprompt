## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, let's break down the key points:

1. **Back pain worsens with standing and improves with sitting**: This suggests that the pain is likely related to muscle spasm or strain, which is more common in individuals who spend a lot of time on their feet.
2. **Hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia**: These conditions can contribute to vascular disease, but they are not directly relevant to the patient's current complaint of back pain.
3. **Normal neurologic exam**: This suggests that there is no immediate neurological compromise or evidence of nerve damage.
4. **Skin exam unremarkable**: This reduces the likelihood of musculoskeletal conditions such as tendinitis or bursitis.
5. **Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses are 3+**: This indicates that the patient has some degree of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which can be associated with atherosclerosis.

Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is **Degenerative disc disease** or **Lumbar spondylosis**, given the patient's age, symptoms, and physical examination findings. However, to further evaluate the extent of the condition, imaging studies are necessary.

The best next step in management would be to perform an **Ankle-brachial index (ABI)**, which is a non-invasive test that compares blood pressure readings at the ankle with those in the upper arm. This can help diagnose PAD and assess the severity of peripheral artery disease. An ABI of 2.5 or less indicates significant PAD.

The other options are not as directly relevant to this patient's presentation:

* **MRI of the lumbosacral spine** (B) may be useful if there is suspicion of a specific condition such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis, or spondylolisthesis.
* **Naproxen** (C) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can help manage back pain but does not address the underlying cause.
* **Radiography of the lumbosacral spine** (D) may be useful in certain cases, such as to evaluate for fractures or tumors, but it is not necessary given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Therefore, the best next step in management is to perform an ABI to assess PAD and guide further treatment.
