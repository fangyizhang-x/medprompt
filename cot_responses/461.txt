## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history and presentation, it is essential to consider her sexual activity and potential risk factors for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that could contribute to her acne.

Firstly, the fact that she has been treated in the past with a combination of oral cephalexin and topical benzoyl peroxide without clinical improvement suggests that her current acne may be related to an underlying condition or infection rather than just a simple case of acne. Oral antibiotics like cephalexin are typically used for bacterial infections, so switching to doxycycline (option B) might not be the most appropriate next step.

Option A, administering oral contraceptives, is not directly relevant to her current presentation and may even have potential side effects that could exacerbate her acne. While hormonal changes can affect acne, there is no indication in her history or physical examination that she has a hormonal imbalance that would necessitate hormonal treatment.

Option C, measuring serum beta-hCG levels, is highly unlikely to be relevant to her current condition. Beta-hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is typically measured during pregnancy and other conditions involving the reproductive system, such as choriocarcinoma or molar pregnancies.

Option D, measuring creatinine kinase levels, is also not directly related to her current presentation of acne. Creatinine kinase is an enzyme found in muscle tissue, and elevated levels can be associated with various conditions, including muscular dystrophy, but it has no relevance to her skin condition.

Given the patient's sexual activity and inconsistent condom use, the most appropriate next step would be to screen for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that could contribute to her acne. This is because many STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, can cause acne-like symptoms due to their effects on the skin and immune system.

Therefore, the best answer is B.
