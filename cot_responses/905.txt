(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, which includes confusion, agitation, fever (101°F or 38.3°C), tachycardia (pulse of 117/min), and hyperreflexia with clonus, we need to consider the potential causes in the context of his recent medication changes.

Firstly, the addition of selegiline to his medication regimen for worsening Parkinson symptoms is a significant concern. Selegiline can cause serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate, and changes in blood pressure. The patient's presentation of fever, tachycardia, hyperreflexia with clonus, and altered mental status strongly suggests serotonin syndrome.

While bacterial infection (A) could explain the fever, it is less likely to cause the combination of symptoms described, particularly the neurological findings such as hyperreflexia and clonus. Electrolyte abnormality (B) might contribute to some of his symptoms but would not fully account for the acute onset of confusion, agitation, and tachycardia.

Viral infection (D) could also cause fever and altered mental status, but it is less likely given the patient's recent changes in medication regimen and the presence of neurological findings suggestive of serotonin syndrome.

Therefore, considering the patient's recent initiation of selegiline and the combination of symptoms described, the most likely etiology of this patient’s symptoms is a medication complication, specifically serotonin syndrome.
