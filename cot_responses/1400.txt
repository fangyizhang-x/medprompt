## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of severe muscle cramping, abdominal pain, tachycardia, hypertension, erythema on the dorsum of the right hand without further dermatologic findings, and firm rigidity in the abdomen without rebound tenderness, we can narrow down the differential diagnosis.

Firstly, the presence of erythema to the dorsum of the right hand is a key finding. This could be indicative of several arthropods, but given the context, it's likely related to an insect bite.

The fact that the child was bitten by a bug 2 hours prior and developed symptoms shortly after suggests that the arthropod responsible for the bite may have been transmitted through contact with contaminated soil or other environmental factors. The presence of erythema on the hand could be indicative of a specific type of venom, which is often associated with certain insect bites.

Among the options provided:

- A. Brown recluse: This spider's venom can cause necrotic lesions and systemic symptoms like abdominal pain, but it typically doesn't present with erythematous skin lesions.
- B. Black widow: The venom from black widow spiders causes severe pain, muscle cramps, and breathing difficulties, which doesn't match the child's presentation.
- C. Cryptopid centipede: While this is a type of arthropod that can bite humans, it's not typically associated with the symptoms described in the scenario.
- D. Tick: Ticks are known to transmit diseases like Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, but they're not commonly associated with the specific symptoms described.

Given these considerations, the most likely cause of the child's symptoms is a Brown recluse spider bite. The brown recluse venom can cause necrotic lesions and systemic symptoms like abdominal pain, which matches the child's presentation.

Therefore, the answer is A.
