Given the patient's symptoms of increased urinary frequency, rapid-onset need to urinate, and occasional inability to reach the restroom, along with her history of rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate, we should consider interventions that address both her urinary symptoms and potential underlying conditions related to her arthritis.

Firstly, considering her symptoms are primarily driven by urinary issues rather than other potential causes like kidney stones or bladder problems, medications that directly target the urinary system would be a good starting point. Among the options provided:

- **Oxybutynin (A)** is an antimuscarinic medication used to treat overactive bladder and urinary incontinence. It could help alleviate her symptoms of increased urinary frequency and urgency.
  
- **Pessary placement (B)** involves inserting a device into the vagina to support the urethra or bladder neck, which can provide temporary relief from urinary symptoms such as frequent urination and urge incontinence.

- **Tamsulosin (C)** is an alpha-blocker used primarily to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which can cause urinary frequency and difficulty starting urination. However, it may not directly address the patient's urgency or urge incontinence symptoms.

- **Topical estrogen (D)** might be considered for women with BPH or other conditions like vulvodynia, but it is less commonly used as a first-line treatment for urinary frequency due to its potential side effects and lower efficacy compared to oral medications.

Given the patient's age and the fact that she has been trying pelvic floor exercises without success, which might indicate a more severe underlying condition such as BPH or another urological issue, addressing her urinary symptoms directly is crucial. Pessary placement (B) offers a non-invasive solution for temporary relief of these symptoms, making it an appropriate initial intervention.

Therefore, the most appropriate intervention in this patient would be **Pessary placement** to address both her urinary frequency and urge incontinence symptoms without introducing additional risks or side effects associated with other options.
