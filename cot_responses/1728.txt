## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS). CTS is a common condition that affects the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel at the wrist.

The patient's gradual onset of symptoms over the past month, worsening at night, and partial relief with shaking her hand are classic symptoms for CTS. The physical examination findings, including decreased pressure and temperature sensitivity over the palmar surface of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd fingers, and increased reflexes (biceps and triceps), further support this diagnosis.

The patient's pregnancy status is also relevant. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome can occur in pregnant women due to fluid retention and swelling in the hands and wrists, which can compress the median nerve. This condition is often referred to as "pregnancy-related carpal tunnel syndrome."

Let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. CTS is a fairly common condition that affects many people, including pregnant women. The prevalence of CTS increases with age, but it is not uncommon in pregnant women.

B. Pre-pregnancy obesity can increase the risk of developing CTS during pregnancy due to fluid retention and swelling in the hands and wrists.

C. Corticosteroid injections are actually a common treatment for CTS, as they can help relieve symptoms by reducing inflammation and swelling.

D. Immobilization (for example, splinting) is often recommended for patients with CTS to prevent exacerbation of symptoms and promote healing.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Pre-pregnancy obesity increases risk of developing this condition during pregnancy.
