Given the patient's symptoms and history, including a dry cough, nasal congestion, intermittent wheezing, and previous upper respiratory tract infections, as well as her eczema, we can consider several potential diagnoses that could explain these findings. However, the most likely diagnosis in this case is asthma.

Asthma is characterized by recurring episodes of reversible airflow obstruction, often triggered by allergens or irritants, which are consistent with the patient's history of upper respiratory tract infections and eczema. The physical examination findings of a shallow breathing pattern and scattered expiratory wheezing throughout both lung fields further support this diagnosis.

The next step in diagnosing asthma should aim to confirm the presence of airflow obstruction and assess for any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.

A) Arterial blood gas analysis is not the most appropriate initial test for diagnosing asthma, as it would require a sample of arterial blood, which may not be feasible or safe in this context. Additionally, while an ABG can provide information on oxygenation and acid-base balance, it does not directly assess airflow obstruction.

B) Chest x-ray is generally not used to diagnose asthma, as it may show signs that are not specific to the condition (e.g., pulmonary edema). However, a chest x-ray may be useful in evaluating for other conditions that could mimic asthma symptoms, such as pneumonia or interstitial lung disease.

C) Serum IgE levels can be elevated in individuals with allergic asthma, but this test is not typically used as a diagnostic tool. While an elevated IgE level may support the diagnosis of allergies, it does not directly assess airflow obstruction.

D) Spirometry is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing asthma. It measures the volume and flow of air that can be inhaled and exhaled from the lungs, providing information on the severity of airflow limitation. A spirometry test can help confirm the presence of reversible airflow obstruction, which is a hallmark of asthma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and history, as well as the physical examination findings, the most appropriate next step in diagnosing this patientâ€™s condition is to perform a spirometry test.
