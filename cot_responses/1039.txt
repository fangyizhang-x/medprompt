## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Initial Assessment:
The patient presents with symptoms of psychosis, specifically delusions (believing he is being followed by the Secret Service) and disorganized thinking (expressing plans to shoot his neighbor). The presence of a gun at home suggests potential harm to himself or others.

### Step 1: Assessing the Patient's Safety
Given the patient's history of threats against colleagues, including firing one, it is essential to assess whether there is an immediate risk to himself or others. The patient's flat affect and suspicious behavior further indicate a high level of agitation and potential for harm.

### Step 2: Considering the Law Enforcement Involvement
The Secret Service is responsible for protecting the President and their immediate family. While the patient's delusions may be related to his employment, there is no clear indication that he poses an imminent threat to national security or law enforcement personnel. Therefore, informing security and law enforcement (Option B) might not be necessary at this stage.

### Step 3: Prioritizing Patient Safety
The primary concern should be the patient's immediate safety. Discussing the diagnosis and therapy plan with his mother (Option A) may provide some insight into the underlying causes of his behavior but does not address the potential threat to himself or others. Warning the person at risk and informing law enforcement (Option C) is still premature without further assessment.

### Step 4: Requesting a Court Order
Given the patient's history of threats against colleagues, including firing one, it is reasonable to request a court order to override his right to confidentiality (Option D). This would allow for a more thorough evaluation and potential intervention to address any underlying issues contributing to his behavior. A court order could also facilitate law enforcement involvement if necessary.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
