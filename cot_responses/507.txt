## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Firstly, let's define what we're trying to find: the number of patients that must be treated with the new drug to see an additional good outcome.

Let x be the number of patients treated with the new drug and y be the number of patients treated with the current standard of care. We know that:

- The new drug has a 30% success rate, so the probability of seeing at least one good outcome is 0.3.
- The current standard of care has a 10% success rate, so the probability of seeing no good outcomes is 0.1.

We want to find x when the probability of seeing an additional good outcome (i.e., y) is equal to 0.3.

## Step 1: Define the problem in terms of probabilities
The probability of seeing at least one good outcome with the new drug can be calculated as:
P(at least one good outcome) = P(1 good outcome) + P(no good outcomes)
= 0.3 + (1 - 0.1) * 0.9

## Step 2: Simplify the equation
P(at least one good outcome) = 0.3 + 0.9 * 0.9
= 0.3 + 0.81
= 1.1

## Step 3: Set up the equation for the probability of seeing no good outcomes with the current standard of care
The probability of seeing no good outcomes is:
P(no good outcomes) = (1 - 0.1) * y
= 0.9 * y

## Step 4: Equate the probabilities and solve for x
Since we want to find when the new drug has seen an additional good outcome, we set P(at least one good outcome) equal to 0.3:
1.1 = 0.3 + 0.9 * y
Subtracting 0.3 from both sides gives us:
0.8 = 0.9 * y

## Step 5: Solve for x
Dividing both sides by 0.9, we get:
y = 0.8 / 0.9
= 8/9
Since y is the number of patients treated with the current standard of care, and we want to find when the new drug has seen an additional good outcome (i.e., y + x),
