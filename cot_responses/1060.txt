## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history of STEMI myocardial infarction 9 months ago, we should consider that his current symptoms may be related to cardiac complications such as coronary artery disease or cardiac dysfunction.

The patient's bilateral lower leg edema worsens in the evening and improves after sleeping or napping, which is suggestive of orthostatic intolerance. This symptomatology is often associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, particularly postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).

Considering the patient's history of myocardial infarction and symptoms that could be related to cardiac dysfunction, we should also evaluate for potential cardiac causes of his edema.

The presence of a soft grade 1/6 systolic murmur at the apex of the heart is concerning and warrants further investigation. A systolic murmur can be indicative of various cardiac conditions, including valvular disease or coronary artery disease.

Given these considerations, we should evaluate for potential cardiac causes of his edema and symptoms.

## Step 1: Evaluate the patient's history of STEMI myocardial infarction
The patient's history of STEMI myocardial infarction 9 months ago increases the likelihood of cardiac complications such as coronary artery disease or cardiac dysfunction.

## Step 2: Consider the orthostatic intolerance symptomatology
The patient's bilateral lower leg edema worsens in the evening and improves after sleeping or napping, which is suggestive of autonomic nervous system dysfunction. This symptomatology is often associated with POTS.

## Step 3: Evaluate for potential cardiac causes of his symptoms
A systolic murmur at the apex of the heart could be indicative of a cardiac condition such as coronary artery disease or valvular disease.

## Step 4: Consider the patient's current medications and lifestyle factors
The patient is taking atorvastatin, aspirin, and metoprolol, which are not directly related to his symptoms. His history of smoking (16-pack-year) also increases the risk for cardiovascular diseases.

## Step 5: Determine the most likely test to reveal the cause of the patient's symptoms
Given the patient's history of STEMI myocardial infarction and symptoms that could be related to cardiac dysfunction, as well as the presence of a systolic murmur at the apex of the heart, we should evaluate for potential cardiac causes of his edema and symptoms. The most likely test to reveal
