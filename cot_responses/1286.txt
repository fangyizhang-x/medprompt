Given the patient's history and laboratory findings, we can analyze the possible causes of his recent infections.

Firstly, let's consider the patient's age (71 years) and ethnicity (African American). While these factors can influence susceptibility to certain infections, they are not directly related to the current presentation. Therefore, option A is less likely.

Next, we examine the patient's medical history. He has had recurrent infections, including pyelonephritis, pneumonia, and possibly a recent urinary tract infection (UTI), which was treated with ibuprofen. This suggests that he may have an underlying immunocompromised state or a condition that predisposes him to infections.

The laboratory findings are also crucial in this context. The patient has a low albumin level (4 g/dL) and elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, indicating impaired kidney function. His ESR is mildly elevated, suggesting some degree of inflammation. However, the most striking finding is the right lower lobe opacity on the chest X-ray and blurring of the ipsilateral diaphragmatic dome on skull and pelvic X-rays.

Given these findings, we can consider several possible causes:

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: The patient's laboratory results, including elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, suggest impaired kidney function. CKD is a known risk factor for infections, particularly those caused by gram-negative bacteria.
- **Hypogammaglobulinemia**: This condition is characterized by low levels of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the blood. While it can increase susceptibility to infections, it is not directly related to the patient's current presentation.

Considering these factors, option C (NSAID-induced chronic kidney disease) seems the most plausible explanation for this patient's recent infections. NSAIDs are known to cause renal impairment and increase the risk of infections in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.

Option B (Hypogammaglobulinemia) is less likely because while it can increase susceptibility to infections, it does not directly explain the patient's current presentation.

Option D (Unresolved pneumonia) is also unlikely as there are no specific findings on the chest X-ray that would suggest a new or unresolved pneumonia.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, laboratory findings, and clinical presentation, the most likely underlying cause of this patientâ€™s recent infections is **C. NSAID-induced chronic kidney disease**.
