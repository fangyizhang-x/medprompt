Given the clinical presentation of this newborn, including a larger than normal head circumference with bulging fontanelles, predominant downward gaze with marked eyelid retraction and convergence-retraction nystagmus, dilated lateral ventricles, and a dilated third ventricle, along with a solid mass in the pineal region as seen on imaging studies, we can deduce that this patient likely has a hydrocephalus caused by an intracranial mass.

The presence of a solid mass in the pineal region is highly suggestive of a pinealoma, which is a type of brain tumor. Pinealomas are known to cause hydrocephalus due to their location and effect on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics.

A key feature of pinealomas is their ability to compress surrounding structures, including the periaqueductal grey matter (PAG). The PAG plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological functions, including pain perception, mood, and sleep-wake cycles. Compression of the PAG by an intracranial mass can lead to symptoms such as marked eyelid retraction, convergence-retraction nystagmus, and altered mental status.

The solid mass in the pineal region is likely compressing the PAG, leading to these symptoms. The normal lumbar puncture opening pressure (A) would not be expected given the presence of a solid mass causing increased intracranial pressure. Dilated cisterna magna (B) might be seen as an indirect effect of hydrocephalus but is not directly related to the pinealoma's compression of the PAG.

Hypertrophic arachnoid granulations (D) are associated with conditions like aquagenic palsy, which can cause bulging fontanelles and other symptoms. However, this condition typically presents in older children or adults, making it less likely in a newborn.

Therefore, considering the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely finding for this patient is compression of periaqueductal grey matter (C).
