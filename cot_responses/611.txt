## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this newborn, including the "punched-out" skin lesions, cleft lip, small chin, convex-shaped deformity of the plantar surface of the feet, holosystolic murmur, intestinal prolapse with a thin membranous sac covering some intestines, and MRI findings of a single ventricle and fusion of the basal ganglia, we can deduce that this patient has several congenital anomalies.

The presence of "punched-out" skin lesions on the scalp is highly suggestive of Treacher Collins syndrome, which is characterized by cleft lip and palate, ear deformities (such as the small chin), and eye abnormalities. The convex-shaped deformity of the plantar surface of the feet can also be seen in this condition.

The holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border could be related to a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which is common in patients with single ventricle syndromes, such as Trisomy 13 or Trisomy 18. The fusion of the basal ganglia on MRI can also be seen in these conditions.

The intestinal prolapse with a thin membranous sac covering some intestines is consistent with Hirschsprung's disease, which is often associated with single ventricle syndromes.

Considering the combination of these findings, we can infer that this patient likely has Trisomy 13 or Trisomy 18. Among the provided answer choices, polydactyly (A) is a common feature in both Trisomies 13 and 18, as well as other genetic syndromes.

Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient is polydactyly.
