## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's analyze the situation: a woman with coronary artery disease is experiencing an increase in heart rate (tachycardia) that resolves after she stops walking and feels chest tightness. This pattern suggests that her heart rate is increasing in response to physical exertion.

During systole (contraction phase), the heart muscle contracts, pumping blood into the circulation. The increased contractility of the heart increases the amount of time spent during each cardiac cycle (systolic ejection period). Therefore, option A is incorrect because increasing the heart rate actually increases the duration of systole.

Option B is also incorrect because increasing the heart rate does not decrease the relative amount of time spent in diastole (relaxation phase); rather, it increases the duration of systole and potentially affects other cardiac phases. Diastolic function can be affected by various factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.

Option C is incorrect because perfusion of the myocardium (blood flow) actually occurs during both systole and diastole. The heart muscle requires a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to maintain its function. During systole, the increased contractility of the heart increases cardiac output, which may lead to an increase in blood flow to the myocardium. In fact, studies have shown that increased cardiac output can improve myocardial perfusion during exercise.

Option D is correct because perfusion of the myocardium indeed occurs equally throughout the cardiac cycle. The heart muscle requires a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to maintain its function, regardless of the phase of the cardiac cycle. During systole, the increased contractility of the heart increases cardiac output, which may lead to an increase in blood flow to the myocardium. In fact, studies have shown that optimal myocardial perfusion occurs during both systole and diastole.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.
