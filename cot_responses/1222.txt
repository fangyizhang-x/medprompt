## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin test is a skin test used to assess the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The proper time to read the test and determine an induration diameter that would indicate a positive test result is 72 hours.

This is because the PPD test measures the body's ability to respond to the antigens of M. tuberculosis, which takes about 48-72 hours to develop after exposure. A reading of 10 mm or greater at 72 hours is considered positive and indicates that the patient has been infected with M. tuberculosis.

The other options are incorrect because:

* 24 hours may not be sufficient for a reliable test result.
* 36 hours may still be too early for a positive result, as some people may have developed an immune response to the antigens before this time.
* 96 hours and 14mm diameter is also not the standard for interpreting PPD test results.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.
