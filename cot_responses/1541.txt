## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's elevated blood pressure readings, age, sex, height, weight, BMI, pulse, and laboratory studies showing no abnormalities, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for this patient would be a diuretic to reduce fluid volume and subsequently lower blood pressure.

The choice of diuretic is based on several factors:

1. **Effectiveness**: Diuretics are effective in reducing blood pressure by increasing urine production.
2. **Safety**: The patient does not have any contraindications for diuretics, such as kidney disease or heart failure.
3. **Cost-effectiveness**: Diuretics are generally less expensive than ACE inhibitors or ARBs, which may be preferred in some cases.

Considering the options:

A. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can lower blood pressure but does not directly address fluid volume overload.

B. Chlorthalidone is a thiazide diuretic that is effective for lowering blood pressure and reducing fluid volume, making it an appropriate initial choice.

C. Aliskiren is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB) that can also lower blood pressure but may not be as effective in patients with mild hypertension or those who are not at high risk of cardiovascular events.

D. Captopril is an ACE inhibitor that can also lower blood pressure but may have more side effects, such as cough and angina, compared to ARBs like aliskiren.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for this patient would be a thiazide diuretic, which is option B. Chlorthalidone.

The final answer is: B
