## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with breast swelling (diffusely erythematous), redness of the skin over her right breast, thickening of the skin above it, and tenderness. These symptoms suggest an inflammatory or infectious process.

2. **Past Medical History**: A total abdominal hysterectomy at 45 years old is significant because it indicates a history of gynecological surgery, which can lead to changes in the local lymphatic drainage patterns due to altered anatomy and potential damage to lymph nodes during the procedure.

3. **Last Mammogram**: The negative mammogram 1 year ago suggests that there are no palpable abnormalities on the breast tissue itself, but it does not rule out other conditions such as inflammation or infection.

4. **Physical Examination Findings**:
   - The right breast is diffusely erythematous and tender.
   - It appears larger than the left breast.
   - The nipple is retracted, indicating possible trauma or inflammation.
   - The right breast is warmer than the left breast, which could be due to increased blood flow.

Considering these findings:

- **Option A (It is a benign lesion.)** is unlikely because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of an inflammatory process rather than a benign condition.

- **Option B (The inflammation is due to obstruction of dermal lymphatic vessels.)** could be a possibility, but it doesn't fully explain the patient's symptoms or the specific characteristics of the skin changes.

- **Option C (The lesion expresses receptors for estrogen and progesterone.)** might suggest a hormone-sensitive condition like breast cancer. However, there is no mention of any hormonal treatments or therapies that would indicate this.

- **Option D (It shows predominant lymphatic spread.)** is the most likely explanation given the patient's history of gynecological surgery and the physical examination findings. The warm right breast could be indicative of increased blood flow due to inflammation, which might suggest a lymphatic obstruction leading to edema and warmth. This scenario is consistent with an inflammatory process such as mastitis or abscess formation.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, history, and physical examination findings:

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
