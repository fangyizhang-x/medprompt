## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Step 1: Analyzing the symptoms and physical examination findings
The patient presents with dark urine, left flank pain, fever, sore throat, malaise, enlarged tonsils, and tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. These symptoms suggest a systemic infection or inflammatory process.

### Step 2: Considering the urinalysis results
The urinalysis shows pink urine with 20–25 red cells/high power field and 2+ protein. The presence of hematuria (blood in the urine) and proteinuria (protein in the urine) indicates kidney involvement.

### Step 3: Relating symptoms to potential causes
Given the systemic symptoms, including fever, sore throat, and malaise, along with localized signs such as enlarged tonsils and tender lymphadenopathy, we can consider several potential causes for a systemic infection that also affects the kidneys. However, the presence of hematuria and proteinuria narrows down our options.

### Step 4: Evaluating option A - Inherited abnormalities in type IV collagen
Type IV collagen is involved in the structure of basement membranes, which are found in various tissues including the kidneys. Mutations in genes encoding type IV collagen can lead to conditions such as Alport syndrome, which affects the kidneys and hearing. However, this condition typically presents with hearing loss and kidney disease at a younger age.

### Step 5: Evaluating option B - C3 nephritic factor
C3 nephritic factor is an autoantibody that can cause immune complex deposition in the kidneys, leading to nephritis. While it can be associated with various autoimmune diseases, its presence does not directly explain the systemic symptoms and localized findings such as enlarged tonsils.

### Step 6: Evaluating option C - Immune complex deposition
Immune complex deposition is a hallmark of several autoimmune diseases, including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren's syndrome. However, this condition typically presents with more widespread symptoms beyond just kidney involvement.

### Step 7: Evaluating option D - Diffuse mesangial IgA deposition
IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease) is a common cause of kidney disease worldwide, characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies in the glomeruli. It often presents with hematuria and proteinuria, which aligns with the patient's urinalysis results. Additionally, IgA nephropathy can lead to systemic symptoms
