Given the patient's bradypneic state, which is a sign of inadequate ventilation, we need to consider how to improve his oxygenation while also addressing his respiratory rate.

Initially, the patient was intubated and ventilated with a volume control assist-control mode. This setting aims to provide adequate ventilation by adjusting the tidal volume (Vt) based on the patient's respiratory effort. However, in this case, the patient is bradypneic, which means he is not breathing at a rate that would allow for effective gas exchange.

The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show an elevated pH and decreased pCO2, indicating hyperventilation. The pO2 is also within the normal range, suggesting adequate oxygenation. However, the SaO2 is 98%, which is lower than the target of 95-100%.

Considering these findings, we need to increase the respiratory rate (RR) to improve ventilation and thereby increase the patient's PaCO2 levels, which will help in reducing the pCO2 from its current value.

Option A, increasing the respiratory rate, addresses this issue directly. Increasing the RR would also help in improving oxygenation by allowing more CO2 to be expelled from the lungs, thus increasing the patient's PaCO2 and helping to correct the acidosis.

Options B and C increase tidal volume without addressing the need for increased ventilation. Option D increases both tidal volume and PEEP, which may not be necessary given the current settings and the fact that we are already using a volume control assist-control mode.

Therefore, the best next step in management is to increase the respiratory rate to improve ventilation and reduce the patient's PaCO2 levels.
