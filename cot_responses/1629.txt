## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI), including fever, chills, and burning micturition. The urinalysis shows 25 WBCs/mL of urine, which confirms the presence of an infection.

The bacteriological culture report indicates the growth of gram-negative bacilli that are lactose-negative and indole-negative, which produce a substance that hydrolyzes urea to produce ammonia. This description is characteristic of Proteus mirabilis.

Proteus mirabilis is a common cause of UTIs in adults, particularly in women who have an active sexual life or are pregnant. It is also more likely to be lactose-negative and indole-negative due to its unique metabolic characteristics.

The other options can be eliminated based on the following reasons:

- Citrobacter freundii: While it is a gram-negative bacillus, it is typically lactose-positive and indole-positive.
- Escherichia coli (E. coli): E. coli is also a common cause of UTIs but is more commonly associated with dysentery or diarrhea rather than the symptoms described in this case.
- Enterobacter cloacae: This organism is gram-negative but typically lactose-positive and indole-positive, making it less likely to be the causative agent.

Therefore, based on the bacteriological culture report and the patient's symptoms, Proteus mirabilis is the most likely cause of infection in this woman.
