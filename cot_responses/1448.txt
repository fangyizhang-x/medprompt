## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To solve this problem, we need to understand the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin and how it reaches its plasma steady state.

Firstly, let's recall that the volume of distribution (Vd) is given as 0.5 L/kg. This means that the total amount of vancomycin distributed into the bloodstream is proportional to the body weight.

Next, we need to calculate the elimination rate constant (Kel). We can use the formula:

Kel = ln(Vd / Vt) / t1/2

where Vt is the volume of distribution and t1/2 is the half-life. Plugging in the values, we get:

Kel = ln(0.5 L/kg / 6 hours) / (6 hours)
= ln(0.0833) / 6
≈ 0.21 hour-1

Now that we have the elimination rate constant, we can use it to calculate the time it takes for vancomycin to reach its plasma steady state concentration.

The formula for reaching plasma steady state is:

tss = (Vd / Vt) \* t1/2

where tss is the time to reach plasma steady state. Plugging in the values, we get:

tss = (0.5 L/kg / 1000 mg/kg) \* 6 hours
= 3 minutes

To convert this to hours, we can divide by 60:

tss ≈ 0.05 hours

Since vancomycin is eliminated by first-order kinetics, the time it takes for the drug to reach its plasma steady state concentration is equal to tss.

Therefore, the answer is D.
