(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is oral thrush (candidiasis), which is a fungal infection caused by Candida species. The presence of white plaques on the dorsal surface of the tongue and buccal mucosa that bleed when scraped off is highly suggestive of this condition.

The patient's history of asthma controlled with inhaled fluticasone and albuterol suggests that she may be immunocompromised, which increases her risk for opportunistic infections such as candidiasis. The fact that the symptoms have been worsening over 3 days and are accompanied by a dry sensation in the mouth further supports this diagnosis.

Considering the above information, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for oral thrush is an antifungal agent. Among the options provided:

A. Triamcinolone is a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation and swelling, which may not be directly beneficial in treating fungal infections like candidiasis.
B. Nystatin is an antifungal medication that is effective against Candida species, making it a suitable choice for treating oral thrush.
C. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication primarily used to treat viral infections such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), not fungal infections like candidiasis.
D. Griseofulvin is an antifungal medication that is effective against dermatophytes, which cause conditions like tinea infections, but it is not the first-line treatment for oral thrush.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition is B. Nystatin.
