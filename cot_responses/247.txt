## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, including fever, severe left knee pain, multiple painful pustular lesions on her ankles and feet, swollen, erythematous, tender knees with edema, and a positive arthrocentesis for purulent fluid, along with a negative Gram stain and elevated leukocyte count in the synovial fluid, the most likely diagnosis is septic arthritis of the knee.

Septic arthritis is an infection within the joint space that can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The presence of fever, joint pain, and purulent fluid in the arthrocentesis sample strongly supports this diagnosis.

The patient's inconsistent condom use increases her risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which are a common cause of septic arthritis in young women. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be to cover both bacterial and fungal pathogens.

Option A, oral penicillin V, is not sufficient as it does not cover all potential causes of septic arthritis, such as Gram-negative bacteria or fungi. Option B, intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin, provides broad-spectrum coverage for common bacterial causes of septic arthritis (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) and a macrolide antibiotic that covers atypical pathogens like Chlamydophila pneumoniae. This combination is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient.

Option C, oral doxycycline, is typically used to treat chlamydial infections, which are less likely given the patient's presentation and laboratory findings. Option D, intramuscular ceftriaxone, provides broad-spectrum coverage but does not include azithromycin, which is essential for treating atypical pathogens.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient with suspected septic arthritis of the knee is option B.
