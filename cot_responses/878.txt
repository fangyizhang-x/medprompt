Given the patient's symptoms, including episodes of pounding headache, chest fluttering, and excessive sweating, along with a history of kidney stones composed of calcium oxalate, we need to consider conditions that could cause these symptoms. The elevated 24-hour urine calcium level further supports the diagnosis of hypercalcemia.

The serum metanephrines and serum normetanephrines levels being elevated also point towards a pheochromocytoma, a type of tumor that secretes catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline). This is consistent with the patient's symptoms of hypertension, tachycardia, sweating, and palpitations.

The family history of thyroid cancer is an important clue. While not directly related to the current presentation, it raises the possibility of a genetic syndrome that affects multiple systems.

Considering these factors, we need to identify which gene mutation is associated with pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism (which could explain the elevated calcium levels).

The RET proto-oncogene is commonly mutated in familial medullary thyroid cancer, but it's not directly linked to pheochromocytoma.

BRAF mutations are more commonly associated with melanoma.

BCL2 is a tumor suppressor gene, and its mutation is associated with follicular lymphoma.

HER-2/neu (C-erbB2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that's overexpressed in certain types of breast cancer. While it's an important target for therapy, it's not directly related to pheochromocytoma or hyperparathyroidism.

Therefore, the mutation most likely responsible for this patient's condition is B. RET proto-oncogene.
