## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The phenomenon described in this question is an example of **complementation**.

Complementation occurs when two or more viruses, each with a different genetic makeup, can co-infect the same host and produce a complete viral genome that allows for the replication of both viruses. In other words, one virus "completes" the other by providing its necessary genetic material.

In this case:

- Hepatitis D (HDV) is a unique virus that requires hepatitis B (HBV) to replicate.
- When HDV was injected into an immunocompromised mouse, it could not replicate on its own and therefore did not produce detectable hepatitis D RNA in the blood.
- However, when co-injected with HBV, HDV was able to complete its replication by providing its necessary genetic material.

The key point here is that HDV relies on HBV for completion, which is a characteristic of complementation. This means that the two viruses can work together to produce a complete viral genome, even though they are distinct and cannot replicate independently.

Therefore, the answer is C. Complementation.
