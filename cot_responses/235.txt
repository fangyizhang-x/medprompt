## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Bilious vomiting and inability to pass meconium**: These symptoms are suggestive of intestinal obstruction or a condition affecting the bowel motility.

2. **Abdominal distension**: This can be due to various reasons including intestinal obstruction, volvulus, or other conditions that cause mechanical obstruction.

3. **Endoscopic biopsy findings**: The absence of Meissner’s and Auerbach’s plexi in the bowel wall is a critical finding. These plexi are part of the enteric nervous system (ENS) that controls gut motility. Their absence suggests an ENS-related issue, which points towards Hirschsprung's disease.

4. **Hirschsprung’s disease**: This condition is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal bowel, leading to a functional obstruction due to the failure of the affected segment to relax and pass stool. The absence of these cells can be confirmed through endoscopic biopsy, which shows the characteristic absence of ENS plexi.

Now, let's evaluate the other options:

- **Ileocecal intussusception**: This condition involves a telescoping or folding of one part of the intestine into another, usually due to adhesions. While it can cause intestinal obstruction and vomiting, the biopsy findings do not support this diagnosis.

- **Meckel’s diverticulum**: A congenital anomaly that contains all layers of the gastrointestinal tract, including the ENS. However, Meckel's diverticulum is typically associated with bleeding or ectopic gastric mucosa, which is not mentioned in the scenario.

- **Juvenile polyposis syndrome**: A condition characterized by multiple polyps in the colon and rectum, often presenting with symptoms of colorectal cancer. The biopsy findings do not support this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, the most likely diagnosis is Hirschsprung’s disease.
