## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Pulmonary contusion and whiplash injury**: The patient has a history of a motor vehicle collision, which is consistent with a whiplash injury. However, this does not directly relate to her current symptoms.

2. **Severe pain in the right flank and muscle spasms**: These symptoms are suggestive of peritoneal irritation or inflammation, such as from a perforated viscus (e.g., small bowel perforation) or an inflammatory process affecting the abdominal cavity.

3. **Nausea with vomiting and abdominal bloating**: These symptoms can be associated with various conditions, including gastrointestinal issues, but in this context, they may also suggest peritoneal irritation.

4. **Abdominal bloating and gas on x-ray**: The presence of gas in the small bowel, colon, and rectum without air-fluid levels is highly suggestive of an obstruction or a mass effect within the abdominal cavity.

5. **Ecchymoses over the anterior abdominal wall following the seatbelt pattern**: This finding is indicative of retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which can occur due to trauma, surgery, or other causes that lead to bleeding into the space between the peritoneum and the muscles (retroperitoneum).

6. **Tenderness to palpation in all four quadrants with voluntary guarding**: Voluntary guarding is a sign of peritoneal irritation or inflammation.

7. **Normal prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time**: These tests are normal, which suggests that there is no significant coagulopathy at this point.

8. **Recent surgery (umbilical hernia repair two years ago)**: This could be a contributing factor to the current symptoms if the patient had an adhesiolysis or another complication related to previous abdominal surgery.

Considering these points, the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms is retroperitoneal hemorrhage due to trauma. The presence of ecchymoses following the seatbelt pattern and the absence of coagulopathy make this diagnosis more plausible than other options.

Therefore,
The final answer is: C
