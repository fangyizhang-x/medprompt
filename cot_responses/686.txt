## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, let's break down the key points:

1. **Rash onset**: The rash started last night, which suggests an acute onset rather than a chronic condition.
2. **Lack of environmental exposure**: The patient cannot remember being exposed to any new detergents or poison ivy, which reduces the likelihood of allergic contact dermatitis or other environmental causes.
3. **Recent medical changes**: The patient has recently started following a primary care provider who is helping him manage his arthritis and a new onset cough, suggesting that these conditions may be contributing factors to his symptoms.
4. **Physical exam findings**: The presence of coalescing erythematous macules, bullae, desquamation, and mucositis only on the upper half of his back is indicative of a severe skin condition.

Considering these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Erythema multiforme (EM)**: EM is an acute, self-limiting condition characterized by target lesions, often following infections or medications. While it can present with mucositis and desquamation, the lack of environmental exposure and recent medical changes make this less likely.

B. **Herpes simplex virus (HSV)**: HSV can cause oral ulcers and skin lesions, but the presence of mucositis and desquamation on the upper half of the back is not typical for HSV.

C. **Herpes zoster (shingles)**: Shingles is caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus, which typically presents as a painful rash on one side of the body. The lack of systemic symptoms such as fever or cough makes this less likely.

D. **Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS)**: SJS is a severe skin condition characterized by mucosal involvement, including oral and genital ulcers, and skin lesions that can lead to desquamation. The presence of mucositis, bullae, and desquamation on the upper half of the back, combined with the lack of environmental exposure and recent medical changes, makes this the most likely diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's presentation and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is Steven-Johnson syndrome.
