## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the scenario, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Location and mechanism of injury**: The patient fell astride his fence while trimming a tree from it. This suggests that the force of the fall was transmitted through the muscles in his back and legs to his genital area.

2. **Symptoms and signs**:
   - Blood at the urethral meatus: This is indicative of bleeding into the urethra, which could be due to trauma or a urethral injury.
   - Perineal ecchymoses (bruises) and scrotal hematoma (bleeding from the testicles): These are signs of internal bleeding that has traveled down through the urinary tract.

3. **X-ray findings**: The x-ray shows swelling of the soft tissue but no other abnormalities, which suggests that there is likely a direct injury to the urethra rather than an obstruction or other structural issue within the urinary tract itself.

4. **Urethral anatomy and function**:
   - The **bulbous urethra (B)** is the part of the urethra that passes through the prostate gland, which is located in the male reproductive system. It's less likely to be damaged due to its location.
   - The **membranous urethra (C)** is a short, narrow portion of the urethra that passes through the perineum and into the penis or scrotum. This part could potentially be injured in a fall onto the genital area.
   - The **prostatic urethra (D)** is the part of the urethra that passes through the prostate gland and is not directly involved in urination.

5. **Most likely damaged part**: Given the location of the injury, the most likely damaged part of the urinary tract is the **membranous urethra (C)**. This is because the force of the fall would have been transmitted to this area, causing a direct injury to the urethra.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the patient's symptoms, signs, and the anatomy of the male urinary tract, the most likely damaged part is the membranous urethra.
