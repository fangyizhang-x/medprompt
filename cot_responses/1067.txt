## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's consider the properties of each enzyme mentioned in relation to thymine nucleotides:

- **DNA Ligase**: This enzyme is responsible for sealing gaps between Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. It requires a 5'-phosphate group from one DNA strand and a 3'-hydroxyl group from another, which are not present on intact thymine nucleotides. Therefore, DNA ligase would be inactive on demethylated thymine nucleotides.
  
- **Telomerase**: This enzyme is involved in the maintenance of telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. It adds TTAGGG sequences to the ends of telomeres by extending the 3'-hydroxyl group from its catalytic site. Telomerase activity does not require demethylation of thymine nucleotides.
  
- **DNA Polymerase I**: This enzyme is a multi-processive polymerase that can synthesize DNA strands with varying lengths and sequences. It has exonuclease activity, which allows it to remove nucleotides from the 3' end of a growing DNA strand. However, its activity on demethylated thymine nucleotides is not characteristic.
  
- **Primase**: This enzyme is responsible for adding RNA primers to the template strands during initiation of DNA replication. It requires magnesium ions and ATP to function. Primase's activity does not involve the removal or modification of thymine nucleotides.

Given that the investigators isolated an enzyme with exonuclease activity on both intact and demethylated thymine nucleotides, we can conclude that this enzyme is most likely **DNA Polymerase I**. This is because DNA polymerase I has been shown to have exonuclease activity that can remove nucleotides from the 3' end of a growing DNA strand, regardless of whether they are intact or demethylated.

Therefore, the answer is C.
