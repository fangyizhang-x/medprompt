## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the scenario**: The patient is a 5-year-old African American female with recurrent respiratory infections and has been administered a Candida skin injection. The reaction at the injection site is not indurated (not hardened), which suggests that there was no significant immune response.

2. **Identifying the type of immune response**: Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is responsible for controlling intracellular pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, by killing infected cells or producing chemical signals that activate other immune responses. This type of immunity involves T-cells, which are a subset of lymphocytes.

3. **Relating the scenario to cell types**:
   - Basophils (A) are involved in inflammatory reactions and play a role in allergic responses, but they are not primarily responsible for cell-mediated immunity.
   - Mast cells (C) release histamine and other mediators during anaphylaxis or allergic reactions, which is not relevant to this scenario.
   - Fibroblasts (D) are connective tissue cells that produce collagen and other fibers, involved in wound healing and fibrosis, but they are not directly involved in cell-mediated immunity.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the absence of an indurated reaction at the injection site, which is indicative of a cell-mediated immune response, the most likely cell type responsible for this reaction is T-cells (B). Specifically, cytotoxic T-cells (CD8+ T-cells) are known to mediate cell killing and are involved in controlling viral infections.

Therefore, the answer is B.
