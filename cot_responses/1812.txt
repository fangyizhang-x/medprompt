## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's consider the developmental process of the ureteric bud and its derivatives during fetal development.

1. **Ureteric bud formation**: The ureteric bud is a branching structure that arises from the mesonephric duct (Wolffian duct) in the embryo. It invades the metanephric blastema, leading to the formation of the nephrons and collecting system.
2. **Differentiation into direct derivatives**: During the first trimester, the ureteric bud differentiates into two main types: mesonephric (Wolffian) and metanephric (renal). The Wolffian ducts give rise to the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts. In contrast, the metanephric blastema gives rise to the nephrons.
3. **Effect of antihypertensive drug**: Given that the antihypertensive drug can adversely affect differentiation during the first trimester, it is likely interfering with the normal formation or development of structures derived from the Wolffian ducts.

Considering these points:

- The distal convoluted tubule (A) and collecting ducts (B) are primarily derived from the metanephric blastema, not the Wolffian ducts.
- The loop of Henle (D), which is part of the nephron, also develops from the metanephric blastema.

However, the **bladder** (C) is a structure that develops from the mesonephric duct (Wolffian duct). Since the antihypertensive drug affects differentiation during the first trimester, it is most likely to impact the development of the bladder, which is derived from the Wolffian ducts.

Therefore, the answer is C.
