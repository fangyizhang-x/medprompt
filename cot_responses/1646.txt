## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Step 1: Identify the key symptoms and signs presented by the patient.
The patient presents with difficulty opening his left eye in the morning, eye discharge, irritation, bulbar conjunctival injection, mild eyelid edema, and a moderate mucopurulent discharge with crusts on the lower eyelid. These symptoms have developed gradually over the past week.

### Step 2: Consider the potential causes of the patient's symptoms.
Given the gradual onset of symptoms, including eye discharge, irritation, and bulbar conjunctival injection, an infectious etiology is likely. The presence of mucopurulent discharge with crusts on the lower eyelid suggests a bacterial infection.

### Step 3: Evaluate the recent history of illnesses in the patient.
The outbreak of tonsillitis two weeks ago treated with ampicillin could be relevant, but there's no indication that this was related to the current eye symptoms. However, it's essential to consider the possibility of an antibiotic-resistant or secondary bacterial infection.

### Step 4: Assess the presence of lymphadenopathy and corneal/eyelid ulceration.
No lymphadenopathy is noted, which reduces the likelihood of a systemic infection. There's no mention of corneal or eyelid ulceration, but this does not rule out an infectious cause.

### Step 5: Determine the most appropriate investigation to establish a diagnosis before treatment.
Given the potential for antibiotic resistance and the need to identify the causative agent, obtaining a bacterial culture of the discharge is crucial. This will help in determining if the current symptoms are due to a secondary bacterial infection or an initial bacterial infection that has progressed.

### Step 6: Consider the other options.
Scrapings with Gram staining (C) might provide additional information but may not be as informative as a bacterial culture for this purpose. Polymerase chain reaction (D) is typically used in cases where the causative agent is unknown or when there's a need to identify specific pathogens, which isn't the case here.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$
