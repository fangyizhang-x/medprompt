## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Step 1: Analyzing the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings
The patient presents with severe, shooting pain in his lower back that radiates down both legs, decreased sensation to light touch over the lateral thigh area and calf, decreased patellar reflex on both sides, and a positive passive lumbar extensor reflex (pain triggers shooting pain down the leg past the knee). These symptoms suggest nerve root irritation or compression.

### Step 2: Considering the patient's history of lifting a concrete manhole cover
The patient's recent activity, specifically lifting a heavy object, is a significant risk factor for certain types of spinal injuries. However, the specific mechanism (lifting) does not directly point to a particular type of injury without considering other factors.

### Step 3: Evaluating the options based on the symptoms and physical examination findings
- Option A (Inflammatory degeneration of the spine): This is unlikely as there are no specific signs of inflammation such as redness, warmth, or swelling.
- Option B (Compromised integrity of the vertebral body): While compromised vertebral bodies can lead to nerve root compression, this option does not directly explain the shooting pain radiating down both legs.
- Option C (Herniation of nucleus pulposus into vertebral canal): This is a common cause of lower back pain and sciatica. The patient's symptoms, including decreased sensation, positive lumbar extensor reflex, and shooting pain that triggers with passive lumbar extension, are consistent with nerve root irritation or compression due to herniated nucleus pulposus.
- Option D (Inflammatory reaction in the epidural space): This is less likely as there are no specific signs of inflammation such as redness, warmth, or swelling.

### Step 4: Selecting the most likely underlying cause
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely underlying cause is herniation of the nucleus pulposus into the vertebral canal. This condition can lead to nerve root irritation or compression, resulting in shooting pain radiating down both legs.

The final answer is: C
