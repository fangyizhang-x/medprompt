## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, including Tanner IV breasts, Tanner I pubic hair, minimal axillary hair, and a blind vagina, we can deduce that she is likely to have primary amenorrhea due to a lack of functional gonads. The absence of breast development or menstruation in a 17-year-old female with these physical characteristics suggests an ovarian failure or dysgenetic ovary.

The patient's family history of early menarche (mother started menstruating at age 13) is also relevant, as it may indicate a genetic component to her condition. However, the absence of abdominal pain and lack of past medical history make other potential causes less likely.

Considering the physical examination findings, the best next step in management would be to investigate the cause of her primary amenorrhea. The options provided can be evaluated as follows:

A. Gonadectomy: This is a surgical procedure that involves removing the gonads (ovaries or testes). It is often considered the definitive treatment for primary amenorrhea due to ovarian failure or dysgenetic ovary, especially if there are no other potential causes.

B. Estrogen replacement therapy: While estrogen replacement therapy may be beneficial for some patients with primary amenorrhea, it is not typically recommended as a first-line treatment in this case, given the patient's age and lack of breast development.

C. Vaginoplasty: This is a surgical procedure that involves creating a vagina using skin grafts or other materials. It is not a standard treatment for primary amenorrhea due to ovarian failure or dysgenetic ovary.

D. ACTH stimulation test: This test is used to evaluate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and assess for pituitary or adrenal disorders that may be causing her primary amenorrhea. However, given the patient's age and lack of other potential causes, this test may not be necessary at this time.

Therefore, considering the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, the best next step in management is gonadectomy to investigate the cause of her primary amenorrhea and ensure that she has functional ovaries.
