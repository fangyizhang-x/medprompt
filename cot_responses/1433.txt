## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and laboratory results:

1. **Blood Pressure**: The patient has a systolic blood pressure in the 130–138 range and diastolic blood pressure in the 88–95 range despite lifestyle modification advice. This indicates that his hypertension is not adequately controlled.
2. **Lifestyle Modification Failure**: Despite counseling on lifestyle modification, he admits to being non-compliant with these recommendations. This suggests that there may be an underlying issue contributing to his uncontrolled hypertension.
3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient has truncal obesity (waist circumference of 44 inches) and is overweight for his BMI (29.8 kg/m2). Obesity is a significant risk factor for developing high blood pressure, particularly in African Americans.
4. **Laboratory Results**:
   - Elevated fasting glucose levels (117 mg/dL), indicating impaired glucose regulation or insulin resistance.
   - Low HDL cholesterol levels (38 mg/dL) and elevated triglycerides (240 mg/dL), which are also associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.

Given these points, the most likely underlying mechanism contributing to this patient's condition is **insulin receptor resistance**. Insulin receptor resistance occurs when the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to increased glucose levels in the blood. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including obesity, physical inactivity, and metabolic syndrome.

The other options are less likely:

A. **Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells**: This is more commonly associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
C. **LDL receptor gene mutation**: While genetic factors can contribute to high cholesterol levels, the patient's LDL cholesterol level is not significantly elevated compared to his total cholesterol level.
D. **Excessive cortisol secretion and activity**: Elevated cortisol levels can contribute to hypertension, but there is no indication in the patient's presentation that he has Cushing's syndrome or other forms of excess cortisol.

Therefore, based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results, insulin receptor resistance is the most likely mechanism contributing to his condition.
