## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's symptoms are characteristic of a sleep terror disorder, also known as complex partial seizures with sleep onset or nocturnal absence seizures.

1. The patient has difficulty sleeping and wakens up frightened in the middle of the night, indicating that she is experiencing episodes of arousal and agitation.
2. She has not seemed confused after waking up, which suggests that her consciousness remains intact during these episodes.
3. Her ability to fall back asleep in her parents' bed indicates that she is able to self-soothe and regulate her sleep environment.
4. The fact that she looks for ways to delay bedtime in the evenings further supports this diagnosis, as it suggests that she may be experiencing distress related to sleep onset or difficulty falling asleep.

In contrast, the patient's symptoms do not appear to meet the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which typically involves exposure to a traumatic event and persistent symptoms of anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions. The patient's nightmares are also not consistent with PTSD, as she reports that her bad dreams occur only once per week.

Normal development is unlikely given the presence of sleep disturbances and nighttime wakings, so option C (normal development) can be ruled out.

The patient's physical examination shows no abnormalities, which makes it less likely for her to have a nightmare disorder, which typically involves specific symptoms such as vivid dreams or nightmares that are distressing. Therefore, option D (nightmare disorder) is also unlikely.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is sleep terror disorder, which is characterized by complex partial seizures with sleep onset or nocturnal absence seizures.
