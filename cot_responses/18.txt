## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key elements provided:

1. **Genetic disease marked by a mutation in a chloride transporter**: This suggests an issue with chloride transport, which is crucial for various bodily functions including maintaining fluid balance and nerve function.

2. **History of chronic bronchitis**: Chronic bronchitis can lead to respiratory complications, but it's less directly related to the genetic condition described.

3. **Family history of infections and infertility**: This points towards a possible autoimmune or immunological component to the disease, as certain conditions are associated with an increased risk of autoimmunity.

Given these elements, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **It may result in corneal vascularization** - While vitamin deficiencies can lead to various ocular complications, there is no direct link between chloride transport and corneal vascularization that would make this the most likely complication.

B. **It may result in the triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia** - This option describes a condition known as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which can be caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. However, this is not directly related to chloride transport or the genetic disease described.

C. **It may be exacerbated by excessive ingestion of raw eggs** - There's no direct link between chloride transport and egg consumption that would make this a likely complication of the patient's condition.

D. **It may manifest itself as a prolonged PT (Prothrombin Time)** - This is the correct answer. Chloride transport is crucial for maintaining fluid balance in the body, which in turn affects blood volume and blood pressure. A deficiency in chloride transport can lead to hyponatremia (low sodium levels), which can cause symptoms such as confusion, ophthalmoplegia (weakness or paralysis of the extraocular muscles), and ataxia (loss of coordination). Additionally, it may also affect the heart's ability to pump blood effectively, leading to a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) due to decreased clotting factor production.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
