## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms of recurring fever, night sweats, painless lumps on his neck, weight loss, and history of infectious mononucleosis, we can start by considering the potential causes. The presence of enlarged, nontender, fixed cervical lymph nodes on each side of the neck is highly suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder.

The patient's smoking history increases his risk for various cancers, including Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, the biopsy results are not provided, so we cannot confirm this based solely on the information given.

Considering the options:

A. Anti-viral capsid antigen IgG and IgM positive - This is indicative of an acute viral infection, which does not fully explain the patient's chronic symptoms and lymphadenopathy.

B. CD15/30 positive cells - This is a marker for Hodgkin lymphoma, but it would require further diagnostic testing to confirm.

C. Leukocyte count > 500,000/Î¼L - While this could indicate an infection or inflammation, it does not specifically point towards a lymphoproliferative disorder like Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

D. Acid fast bacilli in the sputum - This is indicative of tuberculosis (TB), which can cause lymphadenopathy and weight loss but would typically present with different symptoms such as cough, fever, and night sweats.

Given the patient's history of infectious mononucleosis and the presence of fixed cervical lymph nodes, the most likely diagnosis is Hodgkin lymphoma. The additional finding that would be most consistent with this diagnosis is the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells on biopsy, which are characteristic of classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

Therefore, the answer is A.
