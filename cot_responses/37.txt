## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's consider the key points from the question:

1. The patient is a 12-year-old boy with symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, weakness in the trunk, abdomen, and legs.
2. He has not been vaccinated, which raises concerns about potential vaccine-preventable diseases.
3. Physical examination reveals fasciculation (muscle twitching) and flaccid paralysis of the lower limbs.
4. CSF analysis shows lymphocytosis (an increase in white blood cells) with normal glucose and protein levels.
5. Throat swab reveals an RNA virus.

Given these points, we can deduce that the patient likely has a viral infection affecting the central nervous system (CNS), which is consistent with the symptoms of muscle weakness and paralysis.

The key to answering this question lies in understanding how different types of viruses affect the CNS:

- **Viral infections causing lymphocytosis** often involve RNA viruses, such as influenza or HIV.
- **RNA viruses** typically infect cells that have a nucleus, which includes:
  - **Posterior horn cells of the spinal cord**: These are motor neurons responsible for transmitting signals from the brain to muscles. They are not directly affected by viral infections in this context.
  - **Myelin sheath of neurons**: This is the fatty substance surrounding and insulating nerve fibers. While myelin damage can occur due to various conditions, it's less likely to be the primary target of a virus causing lymphocytosis.
  - **Muscle cells (skeletal muscle)**: Muscle cells are directly affected by viral infections that cause lymphocytosis, such as influenza or HIV.
  - **Anterior horn of the spinal cord**: These are motor neurons responsible for transmitting signals from the brain to muscles. They are also not typically targeted by viruses causing lymphocytosis.

Considering these points, the most likely structure destroyed by the virus in this patient is muscle cells (skeletal muscle), as it aligns with the symptoms and CSF analysis results.

The final answer is: C
