## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's symptoms, including a progressively pruritic rash over the shoulders and buttocks for 6 months, recent travel to Nigeria, and the presence of nontender inguinal lymphadenopathy and subcutaneous nodules along the right iliac crest, are suggestive of Onchocerciasis. The microscopic examination showing motile microfilariae in skin snip biopsies is a key diagnostic finding.

Onchocerciasis is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus and is transmitted through the bite of an infected blackfly. It primarily affects the skin, eyes, and hair, leading to severe itching (dermatitis) and damage to these organs if left untreated.

The patient's symptoms and diagnostic findings are consistent with Onchocerciasis:

- The rash described as "progressively pruritic" is a classic symptom of Onchocerciasis.
- The presence of nontender inguinal lymphadenopathy supports the diagnosis, as it is common in Onchocerciasis.
- Subcutaneous nodules along the right iliac crest are also consistent with Onchocerciasis.

The fact that the patient recently traveled to Nigeria and has been experiencing symptoms for 6 months suggests that he may have contracted the disease during his travel. The presence of skin snip biopsies from various locations (pelvic girdle, buttocks, and thigh) incubated in saline after 24 hours also supports the diagnosis.

The microscopic examination showing motile microfilariae is a definitive diagnostic finding for Onchocerciasis.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is B. Onchocerciasis.
