## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, including pain in his left great toe that worsens with activity and improves with rest, hip crepitus upon examination, and a history of unprotected sex (which increases the risk for sexually transmitted infections), we can narrow down the differential diagnosis.

Firstly, the patient's symptoms are highly suggestive of gout. Gout is characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in one or more joints, most often the big toe. The patient's history of unprotected sex increases his risk for gout, as it can lead to the formation of urate crystals in the body.

The presence of crepitus (grating sensation) in the hip joint is also highly suggestive of gout. Crepitus occurs when there are loose fragments of cartilage or bone that rub against each other, causing a grating sensation.

While osteoarthritis can cause pain and crepitus in the hips, it typically does not have an acute onset with activity and improves with rest. Infectious arthritis would likely present with fever, chills, and swelling, which are not mentioned in this patient's history.

Pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease) is another condition that can cause joint pain and crepitus, but it typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms and may be accompanied by kidney involvement. The patient's age and lack of mention of other symptoms make pseudogout less likely.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, history, and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is gout.

## Answer Explanation
The key points that led to this conclusion include:
- The patient's symptoms are highly suggestive of gout due to the sudden onset of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in one or more joints.
- The presence of crepitus in the hip joint further supports the diagnosis of gout.
- The patient's history of unprotected sex increases his risk for gout.
- Gout is typically characterized by an acute onset with activity and improvement with rest, which matches the patient's symptoms.
