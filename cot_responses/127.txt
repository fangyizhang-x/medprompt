## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the information provided, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with unresponsiveness, cold and clammy extremities, constricted pupils, and shallow respirations. These symptoms are indicative of respiratory depression.

2. **History of Substance Use**: The patient admits to using cocaine and heroin, which are both known to cause respiratory depression due to their effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and the autonomic nervous system.

3. **Physical Examination Findings**: Injection track marks along both arms suggest a history of intravenous drug use. This is particularly relevant because intravenous drugs can lead to rapid absorption of substances into the bloodstream, increasing the risk of overdose.

4. **Response to Treatment**: The patient's improvement from unresponsiveness to full consciousness and alertness after receiving IV access with dextrose and naloxone suggests that his respiratory depression was likely caused by an opioid or a substance that can reverse opioid effects (naloxone).

5. **Toxicology Screening**: Although the specific results of the toxicology screening are not provided, given the context, it is reasonable to infer that the patient's symptoms could be related to substances known for their potential to cause respiratory depression.

6. **Comparison with Options**:
   - A. Hallucinogen toxicity: Typically causes altered mental status and visual disturbances rather than respiratory depression.
   - B. Hypoglycemia: Can cause confusion, agitation, and in severe cases, seizures or coma, but it does not typically cause respiratory depression.
   - C. Alcohol intoxication: While alcohol can depress the CNS and increase respiratory rate, it is less likely to cause significant respiratory depression compared to opioids or other substances listed here.
   - D. Opioid intoxication: This option aligns with the patient's history of substance use (cocaine and heroin), physical examination findings (respiratory depression), and response to treatment.

Based on this analysis, the most likely cause of the patientâ€™s respiratory depression is opioid intoxication due to his history of substance use, injection track marks indicating intravenous drug use, and the clinical presentation consistent with opioid overdose.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
