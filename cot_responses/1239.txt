To approach this question, let's first understand what the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve represents and how it relates to the given condition.

The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) in the blood and the saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen. It shows that at high pO2 levels, there is an increase in affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, which allows more oxygen to be released to tissues.

The condition described in the question states that the blood obtained from a male infant shows decreased affinity for 2,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid (2,3-BPG). This means that the hemoglobin molecule in this sample has a lower affinity for oxygen compared to normal adult hemoglobin.

Now, let's consider the possible compositions of the hemoglobin molecule based on the given options:

A. β4: This is an abnormal form of hemoglobin found in some cases of thalassemia. However, it does not typically have a decreased affinity for 2,3-BPG.

B. α2βS2: This is a variant of adult hemoglobin that has a higher affinity for oxygen compared to normal adult hemoglobin. It would actually increase the affinity for 2,3-BPG, not decrease it.

C. α2δ2: This is another abnormal form of hemoglobin found in some cases of thalassemia. Like β4, it does not typically have a decreased affinity for 2,3-BPG.

D. α2γ2: This is the most common variant of adult hemoglobin and has a normal affinity for oxygen. It also has a normal affinity for 2,3-BPG, which means that in this sample, the decrease in affinity for 2,3-BPG would be consistent with the composition of α2γ2.

Therefore, based on the decreased affinity for 2,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid and the typical characteristics of adult hemoglobin variants, the most likely composition of the hemoglobin molecule in this sample is α2γ2.
