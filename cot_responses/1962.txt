## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's understand the key concepts involved:

1. **Michaelis-Menten kinetics**: This model describes the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions as a function of substrate concentration and the presence of inhibitors or activators.
2. **Effect of pH on enzyme activity**: The affinity of an enzyme for its substrate is influenced by the pH of the environment. Generally, enzymes have optimal pH ranges for their activity.
3. **First-order linear kinetics**: This means that the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactants.

Given these concepts, let's analyze each option:

A. **Physiologic pH, co-administration of antioxidant A, no administration of drug B**:
- The effect of antioxidant A increases Km (Michaelis-Menten constant), which means it decreases the rate of reaction at a given substrate concentration.
- Since Km is directly proportional to the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate, increasing Km indicates that the enzyme's activity is decreased in acidic pH.

B. **Acidic pH, co-administration of antioxidant A, no administration of drug B**:
- The effect of antioxidant A increases Km, which means it decreases the rate of reaction at a given substrate concentration.
- Since Km is directly proportional to the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate, increasing Km indicates that the enzyme's activity is decreased in acidic pH.

C. **Acidic pH, co-administration of antioxidant A and of drug B**:
- The effect of antioxidant A increases Km, which means it decreases the rate of reaction at a given substrate concentration.
- However, the presence of drug B (which has an effect on Km) does not necessarily increase Km; in fact, it might decrease it due to its inhibitory effects.

D. **Acidic pH, co-administration of drug B, no administration of antioxidant A**:
- The effect of drug B decreases Km, which means it increases the rate of reaction at a given substrate concentration.
- Since Km is directly proportional to the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate, decreasing Km indicates that the enzyme's activity is increased in acidic pH.

Based on this analysis, the condition under which the metabolism of the drug will be the slowest is when **acidic pH** and **co-administration of antioxidant A**, but not **drug B**. This combination results in an increase in Km (and thus decreased rate of reaction),
