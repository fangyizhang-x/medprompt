## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given that the patient has intermittent palpitations when stressed, exercising, or consuming alcohol, and an irregularly irregular pulse on physical examination, it is likely that this patient has atrial fibrillation (AF), a type of supraventricular tachycardia. The ECG findings of irregular QRS complexes without discrete P waves further support this diagnosis.

Carvedilol is a beta-blocker with alpha-blocking activity, which can be beneficial in treating AF by reducing the heart rate and the force of contraction. However, carvedilol has been associated with an increased risk of hypotension compared to propranolol, another non-selective beta-blocker.

The reason for this difference in adverse effects is due to carvedilol's alpha-blocking activity, which can cause vasodilation and lead to a decrease in blood pressure. This effect is more pronounced at lower doses, where the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blockade contributes to decreased vascular resistance and subsequent hypotension.

In contrast, propranolol has less of an effect on blood pressure due to its non-selective beta-blocking activity, which primarily affects the heart rate rather than causing vasodilation. Therefore, carvedilol is more likely to cause hypotension compared to propranolol in this patient.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Bradycardia (B) is not a typical adverse effect of carvedilol.
* Hyperglycemia (C) is not directly related to carvedilol's pharmacological effects on the heart and blood vessels.
* Bronchospasm (D) is more commonly associated with beta-2 agonists, such as albuterol or salmeterol, which are used for asthma treatment.

Therefore, the most likely adverse effect of carvedilol compared to propranolol in this patient is hypotension.
