Given the clinical presentation of this 7-year-old boy, we can deduce that he has a viral pharyngitis, which is consistent with his history of similar symptoms at the age of 5 years and the absence of cough, hoarseness, or rhinorrhea. The presence of erythematous pharynx with grayish exudates overlying the palatine tonsils supports this diagnosis.

The negative rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococci (GAS) helps to rule out a bacterial etiology, which is less likely in this case given the patient's age and the absence of typical symptoms such as cough or fever. The measurement of antistreptolysin O titer (A) would be more appropriate for patients with suspected acute rheumatic fever, which is not indicated here.

The measurement of antiviral capsid antigen IgM antibody (B) is a sensitive and specific test for diagnosing viral infections such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, in this case, the clinical presentation does not strongly suggest an infection with one of these viruses. The presence of grayish exudates on the tonsils also suggests a viral etiology.

Penicillin V therapy (C) is typically reserved for patients with suspected bacterial pharyngitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, which is less likely in this case given the negative GAS test and the absence of typical symptoms. Obtain throat culture (D) may be considered if there are concerns about a bacterial etiology or if the patient has not responded to initial treatment.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and the results of the rapid antigen detection test, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to obtain throat culture to rule out a bacterial etiology.
