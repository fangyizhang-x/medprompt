## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of left-sided facial pain that started yesterday, worsens with jaw movement or chewing, and is described as stinging, burning, and constant without any rash or skin change on either side of her face, we can consider several potential causes. However, considering her recent MS flare-up and vaccination against shingles, a post-viral syndrome such as Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 (RHS2) should be considered.

RHS2 is characterized by facial pain, vesicles or ulcers on the tongue, and sometimes ear pain. It typically occurs after a herpes zoster infection, which can be caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV), as in this case given her history of chickenpox vaccination.

The medication that is most likely to prevent long-term persistence of RHS2 pain would be one that has anti-herpetic properties. Among the options provided:

A. Carbamazepine - This anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer can also have immunosuppressive effects, which might help in preventing post-viral syndrome symptoms.

B. Amitriptyline - A tricyclic antidepressant that has been used off-label for various conditions including neuropathic pain but is not typically the first choice for preventing long-term persistence of RHS2 pain.

C. Oral acyclovir - This antiviral medication is specifically designed to treat herpes simplex virus infections, which could be a cause of RHS2. However, it's less likely to prevent the persistent symptoms of RHS2 compared to an immunomodulatory agent like carbamazepine.

D. Gabapentin - While gabapentin can be used for neuropathic pain and has some anti-inflammatory properties, it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for post-viral syndrome or Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2.

Given the patient's recent MS flare-up and vaccination history, carbamazepine (Option A) would likely have the most benefit in preventing long-term persistence of RHS2 pain. This medication has immunomodulatory effects that could help reduce the duration of symptoms associated with post-viral shingles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$
