### Step 1: Understanding the context and risk factors for HIV transmission during labor.
The question focuses on preventing vertical (mother-to-child) HIV transmission, which is a significant concern in pregnant women with HIV. The patient's current viral load is relatively high at 1,400 copies, indicating active replication of the virus.

### Step 2: Recognizing the importance of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during labor.
Given that the patient has an active HIV infection and is currently on AZT, which is a first-line treatment for HIV, it's crucial to consider how ART impacts the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) during labor.

### Step 3: Evaluating the options in terms of reducing MTCT.
- Option A (Increase AZT dose): While increasing the AZT dose might reduce viral load, there is no clear evidence that this would significantly impact the risk of MTCT during labor.
- Option B (Add nevirapine to the patientâ€™s AZT): Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment and prevention of HIV. Adding it to AZT might reduce the viral load, but its effectiveness in preventing MTCT during labor compared to AZT alone is not well established.
- Option C (Treat the newborn with AZT following delivery): Treating the newborn with AZT after birth can significantly reduce the risk of MTCT by reducing the mother's viral load and providing a window for the baby to be exposed to lower viral loads. This approach aligns with current guidelines that recommend treating HIV-positive pregnant women with antiretroviral therapy (ART) during labor and delivery.
- Option D (Urge the patient to have a cesarean section delivery): While a cesarean section might reduce the risk of MTCT, it does not address the mother's viral load or provide an opportunity for the baby to be exposed to lower viral loads.

### Step 4: Selecting the most appropriate next step.
Given the information and understanding of the risks associated with each option, treating the newborn with AZT following delivery (Option C) is the most effective approach in preventing vertical HIV transmission. This strategy aligns with current clinical guidelines that recommend this approach for pregnant women with HIV.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
