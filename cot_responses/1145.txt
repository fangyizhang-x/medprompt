Given the clinical presentation of severe retrosternal chest pain that began after an episode of self-induced vomiting following a large meal, it is highly suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The patient's history of frequent vomiting and restriction in food intake are also consistent with GERD.

The physical examination findings, including the crunching, raspy sound over the precordium that is synchronous with the heartbeat, are classic for a pericardial friction rub, which is often associated with GERD. This finding supports the diagnosis of GERD.

To confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of chest pain, an imaging study that can visualize the pericardium and surrounding structures would be most appropriate. 

A contrast esophagram (C) is a specific type of imaging test that involves swallowing a contrast material to visualize the esophagus and upper gastrointestinal tract. It is particularly useful in diagnosing GERD by showing any abnormalities in the esophageal mucosa, such as erosions or strictures.

In contrast, an upper endoscopy (A) would be more appropriate for evaluating the esophagus and stomach directly, which may not provide sufficient information to confirm the diagnosis of GERD. An ECG (B) is a non-specific test that can show signs of cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias, but it is not specific enough to diagnose GERD.

Measurement of D-dimer (D) is a blood test used to evaluate for thrombotic disorders and would be more appropriate if there were concerns about a pulmonary embolism or other thromboembolic disease. However, given the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, this test is not the most likely next step.

Therefore, the contrast esophagram (C) is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis of GERD in this patient.
