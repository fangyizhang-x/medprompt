## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To address this question, let's break down the key points and analyze them step by step:

1. **Patient's symptoms**: The patient is experiencing restlessness, anxiety, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and agitation. These symptoms are indicative of a psychotic episode, which can be triggered or exacerbated by certain medications.

2. **Current medication**: The patient is taking haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication known to cause extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), such as restlessness, agitation, and Parkinsonian-like symptoms like bradykinesia and rigidity. EPS are a common side effect of first-generation (typical) antipsychotics.

3. **Alternative medication**: The question asks for a drug with a different mechanism of action that should have been prescribed instead of haloperidol to reduce the likelihood of developing psychotic symptoms.

4. **Mechanisms of action**:
   - A. NMDA receptor antagonism: This is the mechanism of action of ketamine, which can induce dissociative states and hallucinations but is not typically used as a first-line treatment for psychosis.
   - B. GABA receptor antagonism: This is the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines, which are primarily used to treat anxiety and insomnia. They do not have a primary role in treating psychotic symptoms.
   - C. 5-HT2A receptor antagonism: This is the mechanism of action of risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic that has a lower risk of EPS compared to typical antipsychotics like haloperidol.
   - D. α2 receptor antagonism: This is the mechanism of action of clonidine and other α2 agonists, which are primarily used for hypertension and ADHD. They do not have a primary role in treating psychotic symptoms.

5. **Conclusion**: Given that risperidone (atypical antipsychotic) has a lower risk of causing EPS compared to haloperidol (typical antipsychotic), it would be the most appropriate alternative medication for this patient, especially considering her history of psychosis and current symptoms.

Therefore, the answer is C. 5-HT2A receptor antagonism.
