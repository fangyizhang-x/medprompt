## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's understand the role of Pb82 in the erythrocyte lineage. It blocks the first step of heme synthesis, which means it prevents the incorporation of iron into the heme molecule.

Since the cells are devoid of heme at the end of the experiment, we can infer that the blockage by Pb82 is responsible for this lack of heme.

Now, let's consider what happens when anti-Pb82 is administered. This compound removes the effect of Pb82, which means it allows the normal process of heme synthesis to resume.

Given that the cells are otherwise developing into erythrocytes and have mitochondria (A), cytosol (C), and nucleoli (D) in their mature state, we can conclude that they will still be able to produce heme. Mitochondria are involved in the citric acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation, which ultimately lead to the production of NADH and FADH2, both of which are necessary for heme synthesis.

Therefore, the cells will not produce heme because they lack mitochondria (A).

The best answer is A.
