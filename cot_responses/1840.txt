## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms of cessation of menses for 6 months and decreased peripheral vision, particularly noticeable when driving, we should consider a potential underlying cause that could explain both her menstrual irregularities and visual disturbances.

Firstly, let's evaluate the options provided:

A. Breast mass - While breast masses can be associated with various conditions, there is no direct link between them and the symptoms described in this scenario.

B. Decreased bone density - This option is highly relevant to the patient's presentation. The cessation of menses for 6 months can lead to a decrease in estrogen levels, which are essential for maintaining bone health. Decreased estrogen levels can cause osteoporosis, leading to decreased bone density and potentially causing visual disturbances such as blurred vision or double vision due to the compression of the optic nerve by the thinning bones.

C. Enlarged thyroid - While an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) can be associated with various conditions, it is not directly linked to the symptoms described in this scenario.

D. Renal failure - There is no indication that the patient has any underlying kidney issues or renal problems that would lead to decreased bone density or visual disturbances.

Considering these factors, the most likely physical finding that may be discovered upon further work-up is decreased bone density due to the cessation of menses and its potential impact on estrogen levels.

The final answer is: B
