Given the patient's presentation with white scaly papules and plaques on various body parts, including extensor arms, elbows, knees, shins, ears, eyebrows, and scalp, along with itchy and irritating lesions, pinpoint bleeding upon scraping away scales, and normal vital signs, the most likely diagnosis is psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition characterized by an overactive immune response leading to excessive skin cell production, resulting in thick, red, scaly plaques.

The presence of pinpoint bleeding upon scraping away scales further supports this diagnosis, as it indicates the formation of pustules or vesicles which are characteristic of psoriatic lesions. Given these clinical features and the fact that there is no mention of other conditions such as eczema, acne, or dermatitis herpetiformis, a definitive diagnosis can be made.

A skin biopsy (Option A) would be more appropriate if there were concerns about a specific type of skin lesion or if the patient had a history suggestive of another condition. Serum autoantibodies (Option B), such as rheumatoid factor or anti-nuclear antibodies, are typically used to diagnose autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which do not primarily present with scaly plaques and pinpoint bleeding.

Wood’s lamp (Option D) is a diagnostic tool that can help identify certain skin conditions, including vitiligo, but it would not be the best initial test for this patient's condition. Wood’s lamp is more useful in diagnosing conditions like vitiligo or lichen planus, which do not primarily present with scaly plaques and pinpoint bleeding.

Therefore, the best initial test for this patient’s condition, given his clinical presentation and the absence of other suggestive features, would be a skin biopsy (Option A), as it can provide a definitive diagnosis of psoriasis.
