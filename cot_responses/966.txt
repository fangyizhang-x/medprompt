(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history and current symptoms, the most appropriate next step is to address her concern about having children while managing her endometrial hyperplasia with atypia.

Firstly, it's essential to note that the presence of estrogen-receptor positive intraductal carcinoma (ER-IC) of the breast indicates a high risk of recurrence and progression. Therefore, any surgical intervention should be carefully considered.

Option A, Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, is a major surgery that involves removing the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. While it may alleviate symptoms related to endometrial hyperplasia, it's not the most appropriate next step for several reasons:

- It would also remove the cervix, which could potentially increase the risk of cervical cancer.
- The patient is trying to conceive, so removing her reproductive organs might impact future fertility.

Option B, Partial, cervix-sparing hysterectomy, is a less invasive option that removes the uterus but leaves the cervix intact. This approach may be considered if the patient's life expectancy is uncertain or if she has other medical conditions that would make major surgery risky. However, given her age and the presence of ER-IC, this might not be sufficient.

Option C, Start progestin-only therapy, is a treatment option for endometrial hyperplasia but does not address the underlying cause of the condition. Progestin-only therapy can help regulate menstrual cycles and reduce symptoms, but it may not eliminate the risk of progression to cancer.

Option D, Observation with annual endometrial biopsies, is the most appropriate next step. This approach involves regular endometrial biopsies to monitor for any changes in the hyperplastic tissue. Given the patient's history of ER-IC and atypia, it's crucial to closely follow up with her to detect any potential progression or recurrence.

Therefore, the best course of action is to start progestin-only therapy (Option C) as a supportive measure while monitoring for any changes in the endometrial tissue through annual endometrial biopsies. This approach balances the need to manage symptoms and address the underlying condition with the importance of early detection and intervention.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
