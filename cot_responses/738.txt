## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most appropriate next step in management is to investigate the cause of his urinary frequency, which is likely related to an enlarged prostate.

The digital rectal examination (DRE) has already identified a nontender, firm, symmetrically enlarged prostate with no nodules. This finding strongly suggests benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a common condition in older adults that can cause urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia.

While the patient's symptoms are concerning for BPH, it is essential to rule out other potential causes of his symptoms, such as an overactive bladder or prostate cancer. Therefore, we should consider the following options:

A. Urinalysis: This test can help identify any abnormalities in the urine, but it is not specific for diagnosing BPH.

B. Urine cytology: This test can detect abnormal cells in the urine, which could be indicative of a urinary tract infection or other conditions. However, it is not typically used to diagnose BPH.

C. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level: While an elevated PSA level may indicate prostate cancer, it is also a common finding in men with BPH. A PSA test can help identify whether the patient has prostate cancer or BPH.

D. Uroflowmetry: This test measures the flow rate of urine and can help assess the function of the bladder and urethra. It may be useful in evaluating patients with urinary frequency, but it is not typically used to diagnose BPH.

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a serum PSA level test to evaluate for prostate cancer or BPH. This will help determine whether further diagnostic testing is needed.

Therefore, the answer is C. Serum prostate-specific antigen level.
