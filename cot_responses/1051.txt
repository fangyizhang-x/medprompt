## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The researcher initially conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 900 patients, divided equally between two groups: one receiving annual DEXA screening and the other not. The study found similar rates of fractures in both groups.

However, the researcher then forgot to include 400 additional patients in his analysis. This means that the total number of participants in the analysis is now 1500 (900 + 1000).

When analyzing a larger sample size, several changes occur:

1. **Increased precision**: With more data points, the researcher can be more confident in their estimates and conclusions.
2. **Reduced standard error**: The standard error decreases as the sample size increases, which means that the researcher is less likely to observe an effect of 0 (i.e., no difference between groups).
3. **Wider confidence intervals**: As the sample size increases, the confidence interval for the difference in fracture rates will be wider.
4. **Increased power**: The study's ability to detect a statistically significant difference between groups will increase.

Including the additional 400 patients would result in:

- A wider confidence interval (B) because the increased sample size provides more information about the population parameters.
- Decreased significance level of results (A) because the larger sample size reduces the probability of observing an effect by chance, making it less likely to reject the null hypothesis when it is truly false.

The researcher would not experience a decreased probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is truly false (C), as the increased precision and confidence in estimates will make it more difficult to detect a statistically significant difference. Additionally, including more participants may actually increase external validity of results (D) because the sample is now representative of the larger population.

Therefore, the answer is B.
