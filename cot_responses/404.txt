Given the clinical presentation of this 5-year-old boy, let's analyze the key findings and how they relate to each potential diagnosis:

1. **Blood pressure in the right upper extremity**: The blood pressure is elevated (150/80 mm Hg) in the right upper extremity, which could suggest a variety of conditions including coarctation of the aorta or other vascular anomalies.

2. **Radial and femoral pulses are felt**: This finding supports the presence of collateral circulation to compensate for the obstruction in the aorta. However, it does not rule out other causes of hypertension in the upper extremities.

3. **Cardiac auscultation findings**: The regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 suggest that there is no significant cardiac pathology at this time.

4. **Systolic ejection click over the left sternal border and back**: This finding is highly suggestive of a congenital heart defect, particularly one that involves the aorta or its major branches.

5. **Normal point of maximal impact (PMI)**: The PMI is an important factor in diagnosing certain conditions, such as coarctation of the aorta, where it may be difficult to palpate blood flow distal to the obstruction due to collateral circulation.

Considering these findings:

- **Takayasu arteritis** typically presents with systemic symptoms and can affect multiple arteries, including those in the upper extremities. However, it is less likely given the lack of systemic symptoms and normal PMI.

- **Interrupted aortic arch (AAA)** would more commonly present with severe hypertension in the arms due to the absence of collateral circulation, which does not match this patient's presentation.

- **Pheochromocytoma** typically presents with episodic hypertension, headaches, sweating, and palpitations. While it can cause hypertension, it is less likely given the lack of these symptoms and the specific cardiac auscultation findings.

- **Coarctation of the aorta (C)** is the most likely diagnosis given the combination of hypertension in the upper extremities, systolic ejection click on cardiac auscultation, normal PMI, and absence of systemic symptoms. Coarctation involves narrowing of the aortic isthmus, which can lead to collateral circulation compensating for the obstruction.

The presence of a systolic ejection click is particularly suggestive of coarctation of the
