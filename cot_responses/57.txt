## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Step 1: Analyzing the symptoms and physical examination findings
The patient presents with fatigue, worsening abdominal pain, excessive night sweats, significant weight loss, a neck swelling, splenomegaly, and enlarged lymph nodes in the axilla, mediastinum, and cervical regions. These symptoms suggest a systemic illness that is affecting multiple organ systems.

### Step 2: Considering the CT scan findings
The CT scan shows massively enlarged lymph nodes in various locations, which indicates a significant lymphadenopathy. The presence of splenomegaly further supports the involvement of the lymphatic system.

### Step 3: Understanding the immunophenotypic analysis of the excised cervical lymph node
The analysis reveals that the lymphocytes are positive for CD20, which is a hallmark marker for B-cell lymphomas. A high proliferative index also suggests an aggressive disease process.

### Step 4: Evaluating the differential diagnoses based on the findings
- **Adult T-cell lymphoma (A)**: Typically presents with fever, weight loss, and splenomegaly but does not typically show CD20 positivity.
- **Burkitt lymphoma (B)**: A high-grade B-cell lymphoma that often presents in children or young adults. It is characterized by a high proliferation rate and CD20 positivity, which matches the findings in this case.
- **Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (C)**: While it can present with lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, it typically shows CD30 and/or CD15 expression, not CD20.
- **Hodgkin lymphoma (D)**: Typically presents with a more classical presentation of lymph node involvement, often with Reed-Sternberg cells. It does not characteristically show CD20 positivity.

### Step 5: Selecting the most likely diagnosis
Based on the combination of systemic symptoms, physical examination findings, CT scan results, and immunophenotypic analysis, Burkitt lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis due to its characteristic presentation with high proliferation rate, CD20 positivity, and involvement of multiple lymph node sites.

The final answer is: B
