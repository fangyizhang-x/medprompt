## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms of double vision (ptosis of the right eye with deviation down and out) and headache, along with his medical history, we can deduce that this is likely an acute condition affecting the cranial nerves controlling eye movement.

Firstly, let's consider the visual acuity in both eyes. Since it is not affected, this rules out conditions like optic neuritis or papilledema, which typically cause visual disturbances.

Next, we need to identify the nerve responsible for controlling the muscles that move the eyeball. The oculomotor nerve (B) controls most of these muscles, including the levator palpebrae superioris, which elevates the eyelid. Damage to this nerve can result in ptosis and diplopia (double vision).

The trochlear nerve (A), responsible for controlling the superior oblique muscle, is less likely given the patient's symptoms. The abducens nerve (C) controls the lateral rectus muscle, which is not affected by the described symptoms.

Lastly, the facial nerve (D) controls muscles of facial expression and taste, among other functions, but it does not control eye movement.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely impaired cranial nerve is the oculomotor nerve (B).
