## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), specifically chlamydial infection.

The patient's history of inconsistent condom use increases her risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as chlamydia. The presence of lower abdominal pain, purulent vaginal discharge, uterine and adnexal tenderness, and small amounts of bloody cervical discharge on pelvic examination further supports this diagnosis.

The laboratory results, including the elevated leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, also support an inflammatory process. The nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) confirms the suspected diagnosis of chlamydia.

Given the confirmed diagnosis of chlamydial infection, the next appropriate step in management is to treat the patient with antibiotics. 

The options can be evaluated as follows:

A. CT scan of the abdomen: While a CT scan may be useful for evaluating complications of PID or other conditions, it is not the most appropriate next step in managing this patient.

B. Colposcopy: A colposcopy is typically performed to evaluate for cervical abnormalities that could be causing symptoms such as bleeding or discharge. However, given the confirmed diagnosis of chlamydial infection and the presence of uterine and adnexal tenderness on pelvic examination, a colposcopy may not be immediately necessary.

C. Pap smear: A Pap smear is typically performed to evaluate for cervical abnormalities that could be causing symptoms such as bleeding or discharge. However, given the confirmed diagnosis of chlamydial infection and the presence of uterine and adnexal tenderness on pelvic examination, a Pap smear may not be immediately necessary.

D. HIV test: Given the patient's history of inconsistent condom use and the presence of lower abdominal pain, purulent vaginal discharge, uterine and adnexal tenderness, and small amounts of bloody cervical discharge, an HIV test is essential to rule out other STIs that could cause similar symptoms.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform an HIV test to ensure that the patient does not have a co-infection with HIV.
