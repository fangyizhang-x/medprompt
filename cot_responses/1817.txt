## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine where the binding site for an amino acid is in the theoretical structure of tRNA, let's consider how tRNA works and its role in DNA replication.

tRNA (transfer RNA) plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by bringing specific amino acids to the ribosome during translation. The structure of tRNA includes a stem-loop structure that forms a hairpin shape when it binds to an amino acid. This binding site is located at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

Given this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is:
