(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's age, symptoms, and laboratory results, we can start by considering potential causes for his current condition.

Firstly, the patient is 60 years old, which increases his risk for certain kidney diseases. Chronic pyelonephritis (A) might be a consideration given the patient's history of hip replacement surgery and recent onset of hematuria (blood in urine), but it would not typically present with such a high level of proteinuria (protein in urine). Acute tubular necrosis (B) is more likely to cause acute kidney injury, which may not fully explain the patient's chronic symptoms. Membranous nephropathy (C) can be associated with analgesic use and might show some abnormalities on laboratory tests, but it typically does not present with such a high level of proteinuria.

The patient's recent onset of hematuria following hip replacement surgery is highly suggestive of analgesic nephropathy (D). This condition occurs when long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other pain medications leads to kidney damage. The laboratory results, including the elevated 24-hour urine protein excretion and significant proteinuria, support this diagnosis.

Analgesic nephropathy is a well-known complication of chronic NSAID use, particularly in older adults with pre-existing renal impairment. It can cause a range of symptoms, from mild hematuria to severe kidney damage, which may not be immediately apparent until months or years after the initiation of analgesics.

In contrast, chronic pyelonephritis (A) would more likely present with signs of urinary tract infection, such as dysuria (painful urination), frequency, and urgency. Acute tubular necrosis (B) might show some abnormalities on laboratory tests but typically does not cause the level of proteinuria seen in this patient.

Membranous nephropathy (C) can present with a range of symptoms, including hematuria, proteinuria, and hypertension, but it is less likely to be associated with analgesic use and would more typically show abnormalities on laboratory tests such as elevated serum creatinine or eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate).

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is analgesic nephropathy due to long-term NSAID use.
