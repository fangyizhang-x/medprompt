## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's consider the key points:

1. **Sjögren’s syndrome is an autoimmune disease**: This means that the woman's immune system has mistakenly attacked her own tissues, leading to inflammation and damage.
2. **The condition typically affects exocrine glands**: In this case, it seems to be affecting the salivary and lacrimal glands, given the symptoms of dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes (xerophthalmia).
3. **Autoantibodies are often present in autoimmune diseases**: These antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that mistakenly target and damage healthy tissues.
4. **The specific antibody associated with Sjögren’s syndrome is Anti-SS-B (anti-La)**: This antibody is commonly found in patients with this disease.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Anti-cyclic citrullinated antibodies (Anti-CCP)**: These are more commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis rather than Sjögren’s syndrome.
B. **Anti-SS-B (anti-La) antibodies**: As mentioned earlier, this is a specific antibody often found in patients with Sjögren’s syndrome.
C. **Anti-histone antibodies**: While these can be present in various autoimmune diseases, they are not the most specific or characteristic antibody for Sjögren’s syndrome.
D. **Anti-topoisomerase (anti-Scl 70) antibodies**: These are typically associated with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), another autoimmune disease.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the characteristics of Sjögren’s syndrome, the most likely positive antibody in a daughter developing the condition would be Anti-SS-B (anti-La) antibodies.
