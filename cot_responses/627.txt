## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that the chest pain is likely related to angina pectoris, which is characterized by episodes of myocardial ischemia (reduced blood flow) due to coronary artery disease. The fact that the pain begins after walking at a brisk pace and does not radiate anywhere supports this diagnosis.

The patient's prescription of sublingual nitroglycerin, which helps relieve angina symptoms, further supports this diagnosis. Nitroglycerin works by causing vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), which reduces myocardial oxygen demand and alleviates chest pain.

Given the patient's history of similar episodes in the past 6 months, it is likely that he has coronary artery disease or atherosclerosis, which can lead to intermittent angina. The fact that his blood pressure is elevated (145/90 mm Hg) may also contribute to the development and exacerbation of angina.

The patient's current medications, lisinopril and metformin, are not directly related to the improvement of his chest pain in this context.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the improvement of this patient's chest pain is coronary arterial vasodilation. This occurs when nitroglycerin causes a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, leading to a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand and alleviation of chest pain.

The other options are less likely explanations:

A. Decreased venous pooling would more likely be associated with conditions such as heart failure or orthostatic hypotension, which are not supported by the patient's symptoms and medical history.

C. Increased atherosclerotic plaque stability is unlikely to improve angina symptoms in this context, as it would require significant changes in the patient's risk factors and lifestyle.

D. Decreased end-diastolic pressure may be related to conditions such as heart failure or cardiogenic shock, which are not supported by the patient's symptoms and medical history.
