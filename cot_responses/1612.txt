Given the patient's complaints of fatigue, despite a hectic lifestyle and severe worries about his future, it is essential to consider whether he might be experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression. The presence of these concerns alongside physical symptoms like fatigue suggests that an underlying mental health condition may be contributing to his distress.

The medication choice should address both the anxiety and depressive aspects of his presentation while also considering the potential for long-term benefits.

A. Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which is commonly used to treat depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and other conditions characterized by excessive worry or fear. SSRIs are generally considered safe and effective for long-term use when started at low doses and gradually increased as needed.

B. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be used for short-term relief of anxiety symptoms but is not typically recommended for long-term use due to the risk of dependence, withdrawal, and other side effects.

## Answer Explanation:
The patient's complaints of severe worries about his future, including losing his job, leaving his wife, and not being able to afford college for his children, suggest that he may be experiencing anxiety. The fact that his wife is also present and has expressed similar concerns indicates a potential shared anxiety or worry pattern. Given the severity of these symptoms and their impact on daily activities, starting with an SSRI like Escitalopram would be a reasonable initial step to help alleviate some of this distress.

The long-term benefits of Escitalopram should be weighed against its potential risks, such as increased risk of depression in young adults or elderly patients. However, for someone presenting with severe anxiety and depressive symptoms, the potential benefits may outweigh these concerns.

In contrast, B. Diazepam is not a suitable
