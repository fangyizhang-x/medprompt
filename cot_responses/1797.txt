## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 4-year-old boy, including a history of easy bruising and bleeding gums, a swollen, erythematous, fluctuant, and exquisitely tender mass on his right elbow with expressible purulence, it is highly suggestive of a severe infection, likely osteomyelitis. The presence of a red and swollen elbow, along with the patient's history of easy bruising and bleeding gums, further supports this diagnosis.

The key to answering this question lies in understanding the characteristics of different types of blood smears and their reactions to specific stains.

A. Absence of dark blue cytoplasmic staining upon nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) administration - This is characteristic of neutrophils that are not functioning properly, often seen in conditions like chronic myeloid leukemia or acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, this does not directly relate to the clinical presentation described.

B. Macrocytic erythrocytes and acanthocytes - These findings are typically associated with megaloblastic anemia, which is not indicated by the patient's symptoms or history.

C. Neutrophils with abundant peroxidase-positive granules - This finding is characteristic of acute bacterial infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. The presence of a purulent discharge from the wound further supports this diagnosis.

D. Neutrophils with peroxidase-negative granules - While neutrophil peroxidase activity can be reduced in certain conditions, such as chronic myeloid leukemia, it is not typically associated with acute bacterial infections like osteomyelitis.

Given the clinical presentation and the need to identify a finding that would support an acute bacterial infection, option C (Neutrophils with abundant peroxidase-positive granules) is the most likely answer. This is because the presence of purulent discharge from the wound strongly suggests a bacterial infection, and the specific staining pattern described is characteristic of Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes infections.

Therefore, the peripheral blood smear in this patient would most likely reveal neutrophils with abundant peroxidase-positive granules.
