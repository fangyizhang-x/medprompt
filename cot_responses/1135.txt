## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we should consider screening tests that are sensitive to lung abnormalities, particularly those related to COPD.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option:

A. Low-dose CT: While a low-dose CT can be useful for detecting lung nodules or masses, it is not the most appropriate initial screening test for this patient due to his history of smoking and COPD.

B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI is not typically used as a first-line screening test for lung diseases like COPD.

C. Bronchoalveolar lavage with cytology: This procedure involves inserting a catheter into the lungs to collect cells from the airways, which can be useful in diagnosing certain lung conditions. However, it may not be the most sensitive or specific test for detecting early lung abnormalities in patients with COPD.

D. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs): PFTs are a non-invasive and widely used screening tool for assessing lung function in patients with various respiratory diseases, including COPD. They can help identify abnormal lung volumes, flow rates, and gas exchange, which can indicate the presence of early lung disease or decline.

Considering the patient's history of smoking and COPD, PFTs are likely to be the most appropriate initial screening test for detecting any potential lung abnormalities that may not be apparent on physical examination. This is because PFTs can help identify early signs of airflow limitation, such as a decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), which is a common feature of COPD.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.
