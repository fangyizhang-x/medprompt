## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's symptoms suggest a radial nerve injury, specifically affecting the flexor pollicis longus muscle, which is responsible for finger flexion at the proximal interphalangeal joints.

1. The patient experienced sudden pain in his right forearm during weight training, which suggests that the injury occurred while he was lifting weights.
2. The physical examination findings of impaired flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joints and intact flexion of the distal interphalangeal joints are consistent with a radial nerve injury affecting the muscles responsible for finger flexion at these joints.
3. The fact that the patient has no history of serious illness makes it less likely that his symptoms are due to another underlying condition, such as a vascular or neurological disorder.
4. The specific muscle affected by the injury is the flexor pollicis longus, which is innervated by the radial nerve.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and physical examination findings, the most likely injured muscle is the Flexor digitorum profundus (D), as it also affects finger flexion at the proximal interphalangeal joints.
