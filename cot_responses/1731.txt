## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, including a worsening pruritic rash, facial edema, lymphadenopathy (swelling of cervical and inguinal lymph nodes), hepatomegaly, and recent diagnosis of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy treated with lamotrigine, we can deduce that this patient is likely experiencing an allergic reaction to the medication.

The presence of a partially confluent morbilliform rash over the face, trunk, and extremities, combined with facial edema and lymphadenopathy, strongly suggests a drug-induced rash. The fact that the rash started after starting lamotrigine also supports this diagnosis.

A positive heterophile antibody test (C) is often used to diagnose infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which can be triggered by certain medications, including anticonvulsants like lamotrigine. However, the clinical presentation described here is more suggestive of a drug reaction rather than an infectious process.

The increased absolute eosinophil count (B) could be seen in several conditions, but it's not directly related to the patient's current symptoms and treatment.

Elevated antistreptolysin-O titer (D) is typically used to diagnose post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which would not explain the patient's rash or recent diagnosis of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Therefore, the most likely further evaluation to show is a Fragmented red blood cells (A), as this is a common finding in drug-induced hemolytic anemia, such as that caused by certain medications like lamotrigine. This condition can lead to a decrease in the number of red blood cells and their components, including fragmented red blood cells.

The final answer is A.
