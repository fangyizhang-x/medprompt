## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of erythema migrans, a characteristic rash associated with Lyme disease. Given the recent camping trip without tick bites, it is likely that the patient has contracted Lyme disease.

Erythema migrans is known to be associated with an increased risk of developing neuroborreliosis, which can lead to complications such as meningitis and encephalitis if left untreated or inadequately treated. The patient's age (21 years) also increases his susceptibility to these complications.

The most significant complication that the patient is at highest risk for without proper treatment is meningitis. Lyme disease can cause inflammation of the meninges, which are the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Untreated or inadequately treated Lyme disease meningitis can lead to serious neurological complications, including encephalitis, hydrocephalus, and even death.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

- Cranial nerve palsy is a possible complication of Lyme disease, but it is more commonly associated with neuroborreliosis affecting the cranial nerves.
- Glomerular damage is not typically associated with Lyme disease or erythema migrans.
- Heart valve stenosis is not a known complication of Lyme disease.

Therefore, the answer is B.
