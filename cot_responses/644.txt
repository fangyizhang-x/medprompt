Given the clinical presentation of a rash on the chest and back that has spread from the trunk, multiple nontender round white macules with fine scaling upon scraping, and no excoriation marks, we can consider several potential causes. However, considering the patient's recent travel to the Caribbean 2 weeks ago and his family history of Hashimoto thyroiditis and severe facial acne, we should also think about infectious or inflammatory conditions that could be exacerbated by exposure to new substances.

The presence of multiple nontender round white macules with fine scaling upon scraping is highly suggestive of a fungal infection, particularly Malassezia globosa. This fungus is commonly found on the skin of many people and can cause infections in individuals with compromised immune systems or those who have recently traveled to areas where it is more common.

The fact that there are no excoriation marks suggests that the condition may not be an acute bacterial or viral infection, which would typically cause more significant damage to the skin. The recent introduction of a new laundry detergent 8 days ago could potentially contribute to the development of this fungal infection by altering the skin's pH and creating an environment conducive to fungal growth.

The patient's family history of Hashimoto thyroiditis and severe facial acne is also relevant, as some studies have suggested that individuals with autoimmune diseases may be more susceptible to certain types of infections or may have a different immune response. However, in this case, the primary concern appears to be the development of a fungal infection.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms, recent travel history, and family medical history, the most likely underlying mechanism of his symptoms is an increased growth of Malassezia globosa, which could be exacerbated by exposure to new substances such as the laundry detergent.
