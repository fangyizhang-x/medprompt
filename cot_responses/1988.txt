## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 10-day-old infant, we can deduce that he is experiencing a botulism-like illness characterized by muscle stiffness, spasms, difficulty feeding, and irritability. The key points to consider are:

1. **Age and Presentation**: The infant's symptoms started 12 hours after birth, which is within the first week of life. This timing is crucial in distinguishing between neonatal botulism (which typically presents within the first few days of life) and other causes.
2. **Difficulty Feeding and Weak Suck**: These symptoms are indicative of a neuromuscular disorder affecting the infant's ability to swallow and feed properly, which is consistent with botulism.
3. **Muscle Stiffness and Twitches**: The generalized muscle stiffness and twitching are classic signs of botulism, as they reflect the toxin's effect on the nervous system.
4. **Irritability**: This symptom can be present in various neurological conditions but is also a common feature of botulism.

Considering these points, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Clostridium botulinum** is the causative agent of botulism, which typically presents with symptoms such as difficulty feeding, weakness, muscle stiffness, and irritability within 12-72 hours after birth. The infant's age, presentation, and symptoms are consistent with neonatal botulism.

B. **Clostridium tetani** causes tetanus, characterized by muscle rigidity, spasms, and a "lockjaw" appearance, which is not present in this case.

C. **Neisseria meningitidis** is a bacterium that can cause meningitis or sepsis, but it does not typically present with the symptoms described here.

D. **Escherichia coli (E. coli)** can cause various infections, including urinary tract infections and neonatal sepsis, but it is not associated with botulism-like illness in this context.

Based on the clinical presentation and the timing of the symptoms relative to birth, the most likely causal organism is Clostridium botulinum.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$
