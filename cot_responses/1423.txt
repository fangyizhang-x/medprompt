Given the patient's presentation of a persistent fever, systolic murmur heard along the left sternal border, and signs of dehydration (hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea), it is essential to consider an infectious etiology for his condition. The presence of a scarring lesion in the antecubital fossa could be indicative of a skin infection or abscess.

The patient's history of heroin and cocaine use increases the risk for intravenous (IV) drug-associated infections, including endocarditis. Additionally, his alcohol abuse can lead to liver dysfunction, which may impair the metabolism of certain antibiotics, increasing the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate next step in management would be to obtain a blood culture to identify any underlying infection and guide antibiotic therapy. This is because:

- Blood cultures are a rapid and sensitive method for detecting bacterial infections.
- They can help identify the causative organism, which may influence the choice of antibiotics.
- Antibiotics should be chosen based on the likely pathogen, taking into account the patient's risk factors (e.g., endocarditis).

In contrast, a CT scan (B) might provide more information about the heart and lungs but is not immediately necessary given the patient's presentation. Ultrasound (C) could be useful in evaluating the liver and spleen for signs of disease but is not the most appropriate initial test given the patient's symptoms and risk factors.

Vancomycin and gentamicin (D) might be considered if a bacterial infection were strongly suspected, but given the potential for antibiotic resistance and the need to identify an underlying pathogen, blood cultures should be prioritized first.

Therefore, the next best step in management is to obtain blood cultures to guide further treatment.
