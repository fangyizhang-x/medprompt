## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation and histologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a non-invasive type of breast cancer. The patient's age, obesity, and family history increase her risk for breast cancer.

The key points to consider when approaching this case are:

1. **Non-invasive malignancy**: DCIS is characterized by its non-invasive nature, which means it has not spread to other parts of the body.
2. **Obesity**: Obesity is a known risk factor for breast cancer, and patients with obesity may have a higher risk of developing invasive breast cancer as well.
3. **Family history**: The patient's mother had breast cancer at age 72, which increases her risk.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate course of treatment would be to monitor the patient closely rather than immediately starting treatment. Here's why:

- **Observation with bilateral mammograms every 6 months (A)**: Given the patient's family history and obesity, it is reasonable to recommend regular screening for both breasts to detect any new or changing lesions early.
- **Radiotherapy (B)**: While radiotherapy may be considered in some cases of breast cancer, it is not typically the first line of treatment for non-invasive malignancies like DCIS.
- **Lumpectomy (C)**: Lumpectomy involves removing the tumor along with a small margin of surrounding tissue. This might be an option if the patient's risk factors are high and she has no other options, but it is not typically recommended as the first line for non-invasive breast cancer.
- **Bilateral mastectomy (D)**: Given the patient's age and family history, bilateral mastectomy would be a more aggressive approach than necessary.

Therefore, the most appropriate course of treatment for this patient is observation with regular mammography to monitor for any changes in her breast tissue. This approach balances the need to detect any potential new or changing lesions early with the risk of unnecessary surgery or radiation therapy.

The final answer is: A
