## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The clinical presentation of this 7-year-old boy is suggestive of a hip condition that is causing pain, limited mobility, and tenderness in the right groin area. The key points from the history and examination are:

1. **Recent onset of symptoms**: The child has had a limp for 3 weeks, which suggests a recent injury or trauma.
2. **Aggravated by running**: This indicates that the condition is likely related to overuse or repetitive stress on the hip joint.
3. **History of similar episodes**: The child had a runny nose and fever around a month ago, which resolved with medication, but this does not directly relate to the current hip symptoms.
4. **Limited mobility and tenderness**: The examination shows limited internal rotation and abduction of the right hip due to pain, indicating joint instability or inflammation.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Unstable proximal femoral growth plate**: This is more likely related to conditions such as Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, which typically presents with a loss of bone density and deformity in the affected leg, rather than hip pain and limited mobility.

B. **Viral infection**: While viral infections can cause joint pain and inflammation, there is no specific mention of fever or other systemic symptoms that would suggest an infectious etiology.

C. **Immune-mediated synovial inflammation**: This is a plausible explanation for the child's symptoms. Conditions such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) or reactive arthritis could cause hip pain, limited mobility, and tenderness in the groin area due to inflammation of the synovium.

D. **Avascular necrosis of the femoral head**: While avascular necrosis can occur in the hip joint, it typically presents with more severe symptoms such as pain, swelling, and deformity, which are not mentioned in this case.

Based on the clinical presentation and evaluation of the answer choices, the most likely underlying mechanism is **C. Immune-mediated synovial inflammation**, which could be related to an autoimmune condition such as JIA or reactive arthritis.

## Final Answer:
Therefore, the answer is C.
