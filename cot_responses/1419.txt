Given the patient's presentation of depressive symptoms, including feelings of sadness and low mood on most days of the week, inability to concentrate, difficulty developing interest in daily activities, sleep disturbances, morning fatigue, lack of energy, feelings of guilt for not accomplishing goals, and suicidal ideation without a plan, it is essential to consider medications that are known to have significant antidepressant effects.

Vortioxetine (A) is an SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor), which is commonly used in the treatment of depression. SSRIs like fluoxetine (B) are also effective for treating depression and can be considered a first-line treatment option for this patient's condition.

Bupropion (C) is an atypical antidepressant that works differently from traditional SSRIs. It has both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibiting properties, which may help improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression. However, it can have more significant side effects compared to SSRIs, such as increased heart rate and blood pressure.

Vilazodone (D) is another atypical antidepressant that has been shown to be effective in treating major depressive disorder. It works by increasing the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, which helps improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression.

Considering the patient's history of erectile dysfunction, a medication that does not have significant cardiovascular side effects or interactions with other medications is preferable. Among the options provided, Vilazodone (D) would be the least likely to cause erectile dysfunction compared to Bupropion (C), which has been associated with increased risk of erectile dysfunction in some studies.

Therefore, Vilazodone should be avoided in this patient's treatment plan due to its potential side effect profile and the need for caution when prescribing medications that may have cardiovascular implications.
