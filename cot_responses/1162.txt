## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Location and mechanism of injury**: The patient injured his right knee while playing soccer, which suggests a traumatic event involving the knee joint.
2. **Symptoms**: Increased laxity (looseness) of the right knee joint when flexed to 30° and an abducting force is applied to the lower leg. This indicates that there is a mechanical instability or weakness in the knee joint.
3. **Normal anatomy**: The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and lateral meniscus are all structures within the knee joint, but their primary functions and locations differ.

Given these points, let's evaluate each option:

A. **Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL)**: The PCL is located in the posterior aspect of the knee joint, connecting the femur to the tibia. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing the knee against excessive forward movement and rotational forces. Damage to the PCL could lead to increased laxity or instability in the knee.

B. **Lateral Collateral Ligament (LCL)**: The LCL is located on the outside of the knee, connecting the femur to the fibula. It primarily stabilizes the lateral aspect of the knee joint and prevents excessive external rotation. While it could contribute to knee stability, damage to the LCL might not directly cause increased laxity when flexing the knee.

C. **Lateral Meniscus**: The menisci are two cartilaginous structures in the knee joint that cushion the ends of bones and absorb shock. They can be damaged due to trauma or wear and tear but typically do not cause mechanical instability or laxity directly related to the specific movement described (flexion to 30° with an abducting force).

D. **Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL)**: The MCL is located on the inside of the knee, connecting the femur to the tibia. It primarily stabilizes the medial aspect of the knee joint and prevents excessive internal rotation. Damage to the MCL might contribute to instability or laxity in this direction but would not typically cause increased laxity when flexing the knee.

Considering these points, the most likely structure damaged in this patient is the **Posterior Cruciate Ligament (P
