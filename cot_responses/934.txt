## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the scenario, let's break down the key points:

1. **Injury mechanism**: The patient fell on the lateral aspect of his right shoulder, which suggests a direct blow to the side of the clavicle.
2. **Tenderness over the middle third of the clavicle**: This area is commonly affected by fractures in this region due to its anatomical location and the mechanics of the injury.
3. **Non-displaced fracture of the middle third of the clavicle**: The fact that it's non-displaced indicates that there is no significant displacement of the bone fragments, which is a good sign for treatment.

Considering these points, let's evaluate the options:

A. **Open reduction and internal fixation with a compression plate**: This option involves surgical intervention to realign the bone fragments and stabilize the fracture using an external fixator or a compression plate. While effective, it may be more invasive than necessary in this case, especially given the non-displaced nature of the fracture.

B. **Open reduction and internal fixation with an intramedullary nail**: This option involves surgically placing a nail into the medullary cavity of the bone to stabilize the fracture. Given that the fracture is non-displaced, this might not be the most appropriate choice as it may require more manipulation than necessary.

C. **Figure-of-eight splinting**: This is a common treatment for clavicle fractures, especially in cases where there's significant displacement or instability. A figure-of-eight splint can help stabilize the fracture and reduce pain by applying gentle traction to the affected side of the arm.

D. **Mobilization**: While mobilization (e.g., range of motion exercises) is an important part of the initial treatment for many musculoskeletal injuries, it may not be sufficient on its own for a non-displaced clavicle fracture like this one. The patient needs to be immobilized to allow the bone fragments to heal properly.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient would be **figure-of-eight splinting** (C), as it addresses the need for stabilization and reduction of pain while minimizing the risk of further injury or complications.

The final answer is: C
