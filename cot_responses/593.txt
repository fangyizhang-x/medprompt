Given the symptoms described, including brownish-gray discoloration of the teeth and a limp with a lower limb length discrepancy, we can narrow down the potential causes to conditions that affect bone growth and tooth development.

Firstly, the presence of brownish-gray discoloration on the teeth is suggestive of tetracycline staining. Tetracyclines are known to cause dental staining in children due to their ability to chelate calcium ions, which can lead to discoloration of the teeth. This condition is more common in areas where the sun's UV radiation is intense.

The limp and lower limb length discrepancy could be indicative of a growth disorder or skeletal deformity. Given that tetracyclines are known to inhibit bone growth and cause skeletal abnormalities, it is plausible that the mother was taking tetracycline during pregnancy.

Among the options provided:

A. Trimethoprim - This antibiotic is not commonly associated with causing dental staining or skeletal abnormalities.
B. Gentamicin - An aminoglycoside antibiotic that can cause nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity but is not typically linked to tetracycline-related discoloration or limb length discrepancies.
C. Chloramphenicol - This antibiotic has several side effects, including aplastic anemia, but it is not commonly associated with dental staining or skeletal abnormalities.
D. Tetracycline - As discussed, this antibiotic can cause dental staining and skeletal abnormalities, making it the most likely candidate for the mother's medication during pregnancy.

Therefore, based on the symptoms described and the known side effects of tetracyclines, the most likely drug taken by the child's mother when she was pregnant is tetracycline.
