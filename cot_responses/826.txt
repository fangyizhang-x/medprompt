To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and how they relate to potential vitamin deficiencies.

1. **Rash and difficulty swallowing**: These symptoms can be associated with several conditions, but in the context of a recent emigration from Nigeria, we should consider tropical diseases that could cause these symptoms.
2. **Erythematous rash with fine yellow scales on eyebrows and nasolabial folds**: This description is suggestive of scabies or a similar mite infestation, which is common in tropical regions.
3. **Oral examination shows an erythematous throat and swollen tongue**: These findings are consistent with oral thrush (candidiasis), which can be caused by an overgrowth of Candida fungi.
4. **Peeling and fissures of the skin at the corners of the mouth and cracking of the lips**: This is indicative of xeroderma, a condition that increases susceptibility to sunburn and skin damage due to impaired DNA repair mechanisms.

Given these symptoms, we can consider vitamin deficiencies that are associated with tropical diseases or skin conditions. The key clue here is the increased activity coefficient in erythrocyte glutathione reductase assay, which suggests an issue with reduced glutathione levels.

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a precursor to glutathione, and its deficiency can lead to scurvy, characterized by symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and connective tissue damage. Vitamin C also plays a role in the synthesis of collagen, which is important for skin integrity.

The other options are less likely to be directly related to the patient's symptoms:

- Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) are coenzymes involved in various metabolic processes but are not directly linked to scabies or xeroderma.
- Methylcobalamin is a form of vitamin B12, which can cause neurological symptoms if deficient, but the patient's symptoms do not suggest this.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the association with tropical diseases, the most likely deficiency is related to reduced glutathione levels, making **Vitamin C** the correct answer.
