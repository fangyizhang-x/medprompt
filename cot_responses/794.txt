## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To address this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the condition**: The patient is concerned about baldness and wants to prevent it. This suggests that the issue might be related to hormonal imbalances, particularly those affecting testosterone conversion.

2. **Identifying the medication's mechanism of action**: The prescribed medication prevents the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is a potent form of testosterone that plays a significant role in hair follicle growth and maintenance.

3. **Linking the medication to its mechanism**: Since the medication inhibits the conversion of testosterone to DHT, it implies that this action directly targets an enzyme involved in this process.

4. **Identifying the enzyme inhibited by the medication**: The key enzyme in the pathway from testosterone to DHT is 5-alpha-reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of testosterone into DHT. By inhibiting this enzyme, the medication effectively reduces the formation of DHT and subsequently prevents hair loss.

5. **Eliminating incorrect options**:
   - A. Desmolase: This enzyme is involved in the early steps of steroidogenesis (the production of steroids from cholesterol), but it's not directly related to the conversion of testosterone to DHT.
   - B. Aromatase: This enzyme converts androgens like testosterone into estrogens, which is the opposite of what this medication does.
   - D. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2): While COX-2 inhibitors are used for various conditions, they do not directly affect the conversion of testosterone to DHT.

Therefore, based on the mechanism of action and the role of each enzyme in the pathway from testosterone to DHT, the correct answer is **C. 5-alpha-reductase**.
