## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's consider the clinical presentation and symptoms:

- The rash started on the face and spread to the trunk, which suggests a systemic infection.
- The presence of fever and cough for 2 days indicates an infectious process.
- The maculopapular rash with blue-white spots on the oral mucosa is highly suggestive of measles, a viral illness caused by the measles virus.

Measles is characterized by several key features:

1. **Rash**: Maculopapular rash that starts on the face and spreads to other parts of the body.
2. **Fever**: Typically high-grade fever.
3. **Cough**: Cough is a common symptom in measles.
4. **Oral mucosa involvement**: Blue-white spots are characteristic of measles, which can include the oral mucosa.

Given these features, we need to determine the causative agent of this condition.

Measles virus belongs to the family **Paramyxoviridae**, which includes viruses that cause respiratory infections such as mumps and parainfluenza. However, measles is distinct from these viruses in several ways:

- **Viral structure**: Measles virus has a single-stranded RNA genome with a negative-sense strand.
- **Enveloped or naked?**: The measles virus is an enveloped virus.

Considering the options provided:

A. ssDNA enveloped viruses - Incorrect, as measles virus is not DNA-based and does not have an envelope.
B. ssRNA naked viruses - Correct, as measles virus has a single-stranded RNA genome without an envelope.
C. dsRNA naked viruses - Incorrect, as measles virus is not double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).
D. ssRNA enveloped viruses - Incorrect, as measles virus is not enveloped.

Therefore, the causative agent of this condition belongs to the **ssRNA naked viruses** family, which includes the measles virus.
