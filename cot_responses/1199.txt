## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Firstly, let's consider the age groups mentioned in the question: pediatric (children) and adult.

- Pediatric patients are more likely to suffer from complications related to their developing spleen compared to adults.
- Splenic sequestration is a condition where a portion of the spleen does not receive adequate blood flow, leading to its atrophy. This condition is more common in children due to their smaller spleens and increased susceptibility to splenic sequestration.

Avascular necrosis (II) can occur in both pediatric and adult patients but is less commonly associated with splenic sequestration compared to other options.
Pulmonary hypertension (III) is a complication of sickle cell disease, but it's more common in adults due to the chronic nature of the disease and its impact on lung function over time. While it can occur in children, it's not as directly related to age group differences as splenic sequestration.

Acute chest syndrome (IV) is a condition that can occur in patients with sickle cell disease but is more common in adults due to their increased exposure to infections and other complications associated with the disease.

Therefore, considering the age groups and the specific conditions mentioned, the pediatric group is more likely to suffer from splenic sequestration.
