## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can analyze the possible causes as follows:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient reports fatigue and urinary urgency, which are non-specific but can be related to pregnancy complications.
2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The fundal height is 25 centimeters, which is below the expected gestational age of 28-30 cm for a 30-week pregnant woman. This indicates that the uterus is not expanding normally.
3. **Fetal Ultrasound Findings**: A proportional reduction in head circumference, trunk size, and limb length are observed. These findings suggest fetal growth restriction (FGR), which can be caused by various factors.

Considering these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)**: APS is an autoimmune disorder that can cause FGR due to placental insufficiency. However, it is not typically associated with non-progressive fetal growth restriction.

B. **Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)**: GDM is a common condition during pregnancy, but it does not directly cause fetal growth restriction or the specific ultrasound findings described in this case.

C. **Pre-eclampsia**: Pre-eclampsia is characterized by hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. While it can lead to complications for both mother and fetus, it typically presents with different ultrasound findings (e.g., placental thickening) and does not usually cause non-progressive fetal growth restriction.

D. **Rubella Infection**: Rubella infection during pregnancy can cause congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which includes a range of birth defects, including heart defects, hearing loss, and developmental delays. CRS is associated with non-progressive fetal growth restriction due to the teratogenic effects of rubella on the fetus.

Given the patient's presentation and ultrasound findings, the most likely cause of her symptoms is Rubella infection during pregnancy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
