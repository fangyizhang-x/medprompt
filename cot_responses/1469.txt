## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient complains of an inability to control his left leg, which started a few hours ago. This suggests a motor symptom that is new and has developed over time.
2. **Past medical history**: The patient has diabetes, hypertension, and a myocardial infarction (MI). These conditions are relevant because they can affect the brain's blood supply and function.
3. **Smoking status**: The patient smokes 1-2 cigarettes/day, which is a significant risk factor for vascular diseases, including stroke and cerebral vasculitis.
4. **Symptoms on exam**: The patient has intermittent wide, flinging movements that affect his proximal left arm. These movements are indicative of hemiparesis (weakness or paralysis) on one side of the body.

Given these details, let's consider the possible brain structures involved:

- **Left internal capsule**: This structure is responsible for transmitting motor signals from the cortex to the spinal cord and other parts of the brain. Damage to the left internal capsule could lead to hemiparesis on the left side.
- **Left subthalamic nucleus**: While this structure is involved in movement control, damage here would more likely result in dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions) rather than hemiparesis.
- **Right subthalamic nucleus**: Damage to the right subthalamic nucleus could lead to contralateral hemiparesis, but it's less likely given the patient's symptoms and history.
- **Ventral posterior thalamic nucleus**: This structure is involved in sensory processing, not motor control.

Considering the patient's symptoms of hemiparesis on one side of his body, which started after a sudden event (e.g., kicking), we can infer that the damage is likely to be localized to the motor cortex or its surrounding structures. The left internal capsule is a plausible location for such damage given its role in transmitting motor signals.

Therefore, the most likely damaged part of the brain is the **left internal capsule**.
