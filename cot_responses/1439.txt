## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the symptoms described for the 31-year-old man, including gradually increasing eccentric behavior and involuntary movements (such as writhing hands), difficulty with short-term memory, physical exam findings of slow eye movements and sporadic rigidity, and a family history of similar symptoms starting at an earlier age, we can consider several inherited disorders that could cause these symptoms.

Firstly, let's evaluate the options:

A. Huntington's disease: This is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by progressive damage to the brain, leading to cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and psychiatric problems. The symptoms described in the question match closely with those of Huntington's disease, including involuntary movements (chorea), difficulty with short-term memory, and physical findings such as slow eye movements and rigidity.

B. Friedreich ataxia: This is an autosomal recessive disorder that primarily affects the nervous system, leading to progressive damage to the spinal cord, brain, and peripheral nerves. While it can cause involuntary movements (ataxia), it typically starts in adolescence or early adulthood, which does not match this patient's age.

C. Wilson's disease: This is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a genetic mutation that leads to copper accumulation in the body, particularly in the liver, brain, and other organs. While it can cause neurological symptoms such as tremors and coordination problems, it typically starts in adulthood, which does not match this patient's age.

D. Neurofibromatosis: This is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the growth of noncancerous tumors on nerve tissue, particularly in the brain or spinal cord. While it can cause neurological symptoms such as headaches and sensitivity to light, it typically starts in childhood or adolescence, which does not match this patient's age.

Considering these factors, Huntington's disease is the most likely diagnosis for this patient due to its characteristic progressive damage to the brain, matching the described symptoms, and the family history of similar symptoms starting at an earlier age.

Therefore, the answer is A.
