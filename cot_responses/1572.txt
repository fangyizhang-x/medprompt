## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The primary concern with the design of this retrospective case-control study lies in the potential for **Observer Bias**.

Observer bias occurs when the researcher's knowledge about the exposure and outcome (mesothelioma) affects how they interpret or recall information from participants. In this context, blinded interviewers will be assessing both cases and controls to determine their exposure to fiberglass. However, if the blinded interviewers have preconceived notions about which group is more likely to have been exposed (cases > controls), it could lead them to ask more questions about the exposures of the cases than the controls or vice versa, potentially introducing bias into the data.

This type of observer bias can be particularly problematic in case-control studies where the outcome of interest (mesothelioma) is often related to exposure. The blinded nature of the interviewers might inadvertently influence their assessment of exposure levels between groups, which could skew the results and lead to incorrect conclusions about the association between fiberglass exposure and mesothelioma risk.

While interviewer bias (A), recall bias (B), and lead-time bias (D) are all potential sources of bias in research studies, they do not directly relate to the design of a case-control study as described. Observer bias is more specifically relevant to the situation where the researcher's preconceptions about exposure and outcome can influence their assessment of participants.

Therefore, the answer is A. Interviewer bias.
