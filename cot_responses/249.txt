## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To answer this question, we need to understand the role of each antigen or protein in the replication and production of HDV virions.

- HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) is a marker for HBV infection but does not directly contribute to the production of HDV virions.
- HBcAg (Hepatitis B core antigen) is also a marker for HBV infection, involved in the formation of the viral capsid and replication, but it's not necessary for HDV production.
- HBV RNA polymerase is essential for the transcription of HBV DNA into RNA, which is then used as a template for the synthesis of new HBV particles. However, this enzyme is not directly required for the production of viable HDV virions.
- HBeAg (Hepatitis B e-antigen) is a marker for active HBV replication and is necessary for the co-infection with HDV because it allows the virus to hijack the host cell's machinery for its own replication.

Therefore, in order to produce viable HDV virions, the scientist needs to co-infected hepatocytes with HBeAg. This ensures that the host cell's replication machinery is available to support the production of new HBV particles, which are then enveloped by the HDV envelope protein and released as infectious virions.

The final answer is: D
