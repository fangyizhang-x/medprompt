To address this question, we need to consider the side effects associated with each medication in the treatment regimen for active tuberculosis.

Rifampin is known to cause several side effects, but the one that stands out as particularly relevant to carbohydrate polymerization inhibiting medications (such as isoniazid) is cutaneous flushing. This condition is characterized by a sudden onset of redness and swelling of the skin, often in the face, neck, or upper trunk.

Isoniazid is also known for causing peripheral neuropathy, which can manifest as paresthesias (abnormal sensations such as tingling or burning) in the hands and feet. However, this side effect is more commonly associated with long-term use of isoniazid rather than its acute initiation during treatment.

Pyrazinamide has a well-documented association with arthralgias (joint pain), which can be severe enough to limit mobility. Ethambutol primarily affects the visual system and can cause optic neuritis, leading to vision loss if not properly managed.

Given this information, the most relevant side effect of the carbohydrate polymerization inhibiting medication in question is cutaneous flushing.

Therefore, the answer is A.
