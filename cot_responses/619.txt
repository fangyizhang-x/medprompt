Given the patient's presentation with blunt abdominal trauma and multiple lacerations, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of such injuries on blood cell counts.

Firstly, the patient's low blood pressure (45/25 mmHg) suggests hypovolemic shock, which can be caused by significant blood loss. In this context, anemia would be a likely consequence due to the loss of red blood cells and hemoglobin.

The presence of lacerations to multiple areas, including the face, upper extremities, and abdomen, increases the risk of bleeding. This could lead to further blood loss, exacerbating hypovolemic shock.

A CBC is a crucial test in this scenario to evaluate anemia and other potential complications. Considering the patient's likely anemia due to blood loss, we can expect:

- A decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) levels, as it represents the proportion of red blood cells that are not functioning properly.
- A decrease in hematocrit (Hct), which is the proportion of red blood cells in the blood.

Given these considerations, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. Hb 5 g/dL, Hct 20% - This option shows a significant decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit, consistent with anemia due to blood loss.

B. Hb 15 g/dL, Hct 45% - While this option also shows a decrease in both hemoglobin and hematocrit, the ratio of Hct is significantly higher than expected for anemia caused by blood loss.

C. Hb 20 g/dL, Hct 60% - This option shows a more moderate decrease in both hemoglobin and hematocrit compared to option A, but still suggests anemia due to blood loss.

D. Hb 17 g/dL, Hct 20% - Similar to options B and C, this option also indicates anemia due to blood loss, but the ratio of Hct is lower than expected for a significant decrease in hemoglobin.

Therefore, considering the patient's presentation with blunt abdominal trauma and multiple lacerations, the most likely CBC result would be:

The answer is A.
