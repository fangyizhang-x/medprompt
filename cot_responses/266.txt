Given that the 6-year-old boy has been experiencing monosymptomatic enuresis (bedwetting) for a month with no abnormalities on urinalysis, detailed patient history, and other diagnostic tests, it is essential to consider the potential causes and underlying factors contributing to his condition. The persistence of enuresis despite referral for education and behavioral therapy suggests that there may be an underlying issue that needs to be addressed.

Behavioral therapy (A) has been tried in the past but did not resolve the issue, which supports the need for further investigation. DDAVP (B), a medication that can help with nocturnal enuresis by increasing bladder capacity and reducing urine production during sleep, is typically considered when behavioral therapy is ineffective or contraindicated.

Enuresis alarm (C) devices are often used to encourage children to wake up and use the bathroom at regular intervals. While they may be a useful tool in some cases, they do not address the underlying cause of enuresis and may even lead to frustration if the child does not respond or wakes up frequently during the night.

Oxybutynin (D), an anticholinergic medication used to treat overactive bladder symptoms such as urgency and frequency, is typically reserved for more severe cases of enuresis. In this case, given that behavioral therapy has been ineffective, it may be premature to consider Oxybutynin without further evaluation.

Considering the persistence of enuresis despite previous attempts at treatment, a thorough investigation into potential underlying causes should be conducted. This might include evaluating the child's sleep patterns, bladder control, and overall health, as well as assessing for any underlying medical conditions that could contribute to nocturnal enuresis.

Therefore, before considering DDAVP or Oxybutynin, it would be prudent to investigate further into potential causes of enuresis in this patient. This may involve reviewing the child's sleep diary, bladder training, and evaluating for any underlying medical conditions such as urinary tract infections, kidney stones, or neurogenic bladder.

The most appropriate next step in management is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation to identify any underlying factors contributing to the persistence of monosymptomatic enuresis. This may involve further testing, including urodynamic studies, imaging, and possibly referral to a pediatric urologist for specialized care.

Therefore, the answer is B. DDAVP.
