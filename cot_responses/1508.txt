## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Step 1: Analyzing the symptoms and physical examination findings
The patient is a 4-month-old girl presenting with vomiting, poor feeding, frequent napping, lethargy, and a bulging anterior fontanelle. These symptoms suggest increased intracranial pressure (ICP), which can be caused by various conditions including infections, metabolic disorders, or structural abnormalities.

### Step 2: Considering the laboratory findings
The complete blood count shows a leukocyte count of 8,000/mm^3, indicating an elevated white blood cell count. This could indicate an infection or inflammation in the body.

### Step 3: Examining the chest x-ray findings
The healing fractures of the 4th and 5th left ribs suggest a possible fracture due to a high-impact injury, which is consistent with a shearing head injury (B). The presence of bilateral retinal hemorrhage on fundoscopic exam further supports this diagnosis.

### Step 4: Integrating all information
Considering the symptoms, laboratory findings, and chest x-ray results, it appears that the patient has a condition causing increased ICP due to a fracture. The most likely cause is a shearing head injury (B), which can lead to bleeding from the germinal matrix in the brain.

### Step 5: Eliminating other options
Malnutrition (A) and inherited connective tissue disorders (C) are less likely causes of this presentation, as they do not typically present with such acute symptoms or specific findings like retinal hemorrhage. Bleeding from the germinal matrix is a possible consequence of a shearing head injury but is not the most direct cause.

The final answer is: B
