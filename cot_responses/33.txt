The management of a dog bite, especially one that involves an animal from whom tetanus vaccination is not administered (as in this case), requires careful consideration to prevent tetanus infection and ensure proper wound care.

Firstly, the presence of a dog bite necessitates prompt medical attention. The fact that the patient was intoxicated during the incident increases the risk of infection due to compromised immune function.

Given that no retained bodies were found, it is unlikely that tetanus infection has already occurred. However, this does not rule out the possibility of future infections or delayed reactions.

The wound irrigation and exploration without finding any retained bodies suggests that there may be minimal tissue damage, which reduces the risk of severe infection.

Considering these factors:

- **Option A (Administer amoxicillin-clavulanic acid)** is appropriate for treating bacterial infections. However, given the lack of retained bodies and the fact that tetanus vaccination was not administered, this option does not address the primary concern of preventing tetanus infection.
  
- **Option B (Administer trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole)** is a combination antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections. While it may be effective against some types of bacteria, it is not typically the first-line treatment for dog bites due to its potential side effects and the availability of more targeted options.

- **Option C (Close the wound with sutures and discharge the patient)** is generally not recommended for dog bites unless there are specific circumstances that make this necessary. Closing a wound may delay healing, and in some cases, it can lead to infection or scarring issues.

- **Option D (Discharge the patient with outpatient follow up)** is the most appropriate management plan. Given the lack of retained bodies and minimal tissue damage, the risk of tetanus infection is low. Discharging the patient with outpatient follow-up allows for close monitoring for any signs of infection or delayed reactions, which can be managed promptly if necessary.

Therefore, considering the above factors, the best course of action for this patient would be to discharge him with outpatient follow-up to monitor for any potential issues related to tetanus infection.
