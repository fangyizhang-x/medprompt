Given the patient's presentation and family history, it is essential to consider the possible causes of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in a young individual with no prior medical history.

1. **Family History**: The patient's father died of SCD at age 36, which raises the possibility of inherited conditions that increase the risk of sudden cardiac death.
2. **Young Age**: The patient is only 25 years old, making it more likely for an underlying condition to be present rather than a degenerative process.
3. **Symptoms and Examination Findings**: The patient's collapse during physical activity, large R waves in lateral leads, deep S waves in V1 and V2 on the ECG, and asymmetric septal hypertrophy are all indicative of a specific cardiac condition.

Considering these factors, the most likely diagnosis is **Asymmetric Septal Hypertrophy (ASCH)**, also known as Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM). This condition is characterized by thickening of the heart muscle that can lead to obstruction of blood flow and potentially cause sudden cardiac death.

The other options are less likely:

- Aortic root dilatation (A) might be seen in conditions like Marfan syndrome or aortic stenosis, but it is not directly related to the patient's presentation.
- Eccentric left ventricular dilation (B) could be seen in conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but it is less common and typically presents with more pronounced left ventricular dysfunction.
- Mitral valve fibrinoid necrosis (D) is a condition that can cause sudden cardiac death, particularly in the context of hypertension or other underlying conditions. However, it is not as directly related to the patient's presentation as ASCH.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and family history, the most likely diagnosis is Asymmetric Septal Hypertrophy (ASCH).
