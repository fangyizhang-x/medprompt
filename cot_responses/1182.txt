## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's symptoms, including lack of facial hair and delayed deepening of the voice, are classic signs of hypogonadism, which is a condition where the gonads (testes in males) do not produce sufficient sex hormones. This can lead to underdevelopment of secondary sexual characteristics.

Given that the patient is Tanner Stage 1, it indicates that his genitalia and other secondary sexual characteristics have not yet fully developed. The lack of facial hair and delayed deepening of the voice are particularly suggestive of hypogonadism.

The development of the olfactory system (sense of smell) is closely linked to the development of the brain and nervous system. Research has shown that the olfactory system develops from a specific group of neurons in the forebrain, which migrate and differentiate during embryonic development.

One of the key factors involved in the migration and differentiation of these neurons is the process of neuronal migration. Neuronal migration refers to the movement of neurons away from their birthplace and towards their final destination within the brain.

During embryonic development, the neural tube forms from a series of cells that migrate upwards from the base of the embryo. As these cells migrate, they differentiate into different types of neurons, including those involved in sensory processing, such as olfactory receptors.

In the case of hypogonadism, the lack of facial hair and delayed deepening of the voice can be attributed to a failure of normal neuronal migration during development. Specifically, the failure of certain groups of neurons to migrate correctly can lead to underdevelopment or absence of secondary sexual characteristics, including those related to olfaction.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms and the developmental process involved in hypogonadism, the implicated factor is:

C. Failure of normal neuronal migration during development

The other options are not directly implicated in the development of this patient's underlying condition:

A. Chromosomal duplication is a genetic event that can lead to various developmental disorders, but it is not specifically related to the development of secondary sexual characteristics.

B. Expansile suprasellar tumor could potentially cause hormonal imbalances or other systemic effects, but it is not directly implicated in the development of hypogonadism.

D. Defect in steroid production is a factor that can affect various bodily systems, including the endocrine system, but it is not specifically related to the developmental process involved in hypogonadism.
