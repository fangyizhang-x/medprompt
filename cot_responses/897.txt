## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the diagnostic findings:

1. **Symptoms**: Profuse watery diarrhea with flecks of mucus that started shortly after returning from South America. The presence of flecks of mucus suggests a bacterial cause.
2. **Physical examination findings**: Dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, and tachycardia (pulse is 104/min) indicate dehydration.
3. **Stool culture results**: Gram-negative, comma-shaped, flagellated bacilli are characteristic of Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera.

Given these points, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **Fluid and electrolyte loss due to inflammation of luminal surface epithelium**:
   - While inflammation can lead to fluid and electrolyte loss, this mechanism is more commonly associated with conditions like acute gastroenteritis caused by viruses or parasites rather than cholera.

B. **Luminal chloride hypersecretion due to overactivation of adenylate cyclase**:
   - This mechanism is characteristic of secretory diarrhea, which is typically seen in conditions like Bartter syndrome or cystic fibrosis. However, the presence of gram-negative bacilli and the clinical presentation more strongly suggest a bacterial cause.

C. **Impaired intestinal motility due to degeneration of autonomic nerves**:
   - This mechanism is characteristic of cholera, where impaired intestinal motility leads to excessive secretion of chloride and bicarbonate into the lumen, resulting in profuse watery diarrhea with mucus.

D. **Excessive water excretion due to osmotically active solutes in the lumen**:
   - While this mechanism can contribute to fluid loss, it is not the primary mechanism underlying cholera.

Based on the analysis, the most likely mechanism of this patient's diarrhea is impaired intestinal motility due to degeneration of autonomic nerves, which aligns with the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings consistent with cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
