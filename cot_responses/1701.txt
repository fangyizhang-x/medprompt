## Step 1: Understand the patient's wishes and situation
The patient has been diagnosed with mesothelioma, a type of cancer that affects the lining surrounding the lungs (pleura). He wants to receive radiation therapy but is unsure about receiving home hospice care due to concerns about his health insurance coverage. His son does not agree with this decision.

## Step 2: Consider the patient's wishes regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation
The patient explicitly states that he wants to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if his heart stops beating, which is a fundamental aspect of medical ethics and law. This indicates that CPR is one of his desired treatments.

## Step 3: Evaluate the disqualifying factors for hospice care
- A. Wish for CPR: The patient's wish for CPR aligns with the principles of end-of-life care, making this choice not a disqualifier.
- B. Uncertain coverage by health insurance: This is a concern but does not directly relate to the patient's wishes or the decision-making process regarding hospice care.
- C. The son's objection: While the son has expressed disagreement with the patient's wish for hospice care, this does not inherently disqualify the patient from receiving hospice care if he desires it.
- D. His life expectancy: Given that the patient is 67 years old and has a poor prognosis (1 year mean survival time), his life expectancy might be considered short, which could impact his eligibility for certain types of care, including hospice.

## Step 4: Determine the most relevant factor
Considering the above points, the most direct disqualifying factor related to the patient's wishes and situation is his life expectancy. This directly impacts his eligibility for hospice care, as it affects how much time he has left with the condition that necessitates such care.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
