## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of complete spinal rigidity (not demonstrating any spontaneous movement of his extremities) and inability to respond to voice or painful stimuli, it is highly suggestive of a spinal cord injury or compression. The fact that he can blink and move his eyes in the vertical plane suggests that there is no significant damage to the brainstem or cranial nerves.

The magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) is a sensitive test for detecting vascular abnormalities in the spine, particularly those affecting the spinal cord. Based on the patient's symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is an occlusion of a vessel supplying blood to the spinal cord.

Considering the options provided:

A. Anterior cerebral artery - This artery primarily supplies blood to the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain, which are not directly involved in this case.

B. Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) - While AICA can be affected by vascular malformations or tumors, it is less likely to cause spinal cord compression compared to other options.

C. Basilar artery - The basilar artery is a critical vessel that supplies blood to the brainstem, cerebellum, and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries (PICA). An occlusion of the basilar artery can compress the spinal cord, leading to symptoms such as loss of consciousness, inability to respond to stimuli, and vertical eye movement.

D. Posterior cerebral artery - This artery primarily supplies blood to the occipital lobe and parts of the temporal lobe, which are not directly involved in this case.

Given the clinical presentation and the anatomy of the spinal cord, the most likely vessel affected by an occlusion is the basilar artery, as it provides critical blood supply to the brainstem and cerebellum, areas that can be compressed by a spinal cord lesion.

Therefore, the answer is C. Basilar artery.
