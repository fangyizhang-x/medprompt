(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and how they relate to the possible answers.

1. **Sudden onset headache**: This suggests a traumatic cause for her symptoms.
2. **Visual problems with double vision**: This indicates that there is an issue affecting the brainstem or its connections, which are responsible for controlling eye movements.
3. **Right eye cannot move right past the midline and left eye cannot move left past the midline**: These findings suggest a lesion or mass effect in the midbrain or its surrounding structures.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

A. **Bilateral uncal herniation**: This is a life-threatening condition where the uncus of the temporal lobe herniates through the tentorial notch and compresses the third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve), leading to ipsilateral oculomotor palsy and contralateral pupillary dilation. While it could cause visual disturbances, it typically does not present with the specific pattern of eye movement deficits described.

B. **Central herniation**: This is a more severe form of uncal herniation where the uncus completely displaces through the tentorial notch and compresses multiple cranial nerves, including the third (oculomotor), fourth (trochlear), fifth (trigeminal), sixth (abducens), seventh (facial), eighth (vestibulocochlear)), and ninth (glossopharyngeal). Central herniation is more likely to cause severe visual disturbances due to its impact on multiple cranial nerves, including those controlling eye movements.

C. **Subfalcine herniation**: This occurs when the uncus of the temporal lobe herniates through the falx cerebri and compresses the third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) in the midbrain. While it can cause visual disturbances, it typically does not result in the specific pattern of eye movement deficits described.

D. **Tonsillar herniation**: This is a less common condition where the tonsils herniate through the foramen magnum and compress the brainstem structures, including cranial nerves. It can cause severe symptoms but is less likely to present with the specific visual disturbances described in this patient.

Given the sudden onset of headache and the specific pattern of eye movement deficits, **B. Central herniation** is the most likely diagnosis. This condition
