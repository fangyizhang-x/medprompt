## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 7-year-old girl, including fever, shortness of breath, productive cough, seizures, upper respiratory infections, and cellulitis, along with her physical examination findings of pale skin, white-blonde hair, and pale blue eyes, we can deduce that she may have a congenital infection or a genetic disorder affecting the immune system.

The history of similar symptoms a few weeks ago suggests a recurring condition. The presence of seizures, which are a common feature in various conditions such as leukemia, lymphoma, and immunodeficiency disorders, further supports this suspicion.

Considering her physical examination findings, particularly the pale skin and hair, we can rule out some options:

- Option A (Predominance of band leukocytes) is more characteristic of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which typically presents with a higher proportion of immature granulocytes.
- Option B (Downey cells) are seen in Down syndrome, but they are not directly related to the symptoms described.
- Option D (Significant basophil predominance) can be seen in various conditions, including allergic reactions and some types of leukemia, but it is not a specific finding for this patient's condition.

Option C (Polymorphonuclear leukocytes containing giant inclusion bodies) is characteristic of certain viral infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), which can cause congenital infection. CMV is known to affect the immune system and can lead to various complications in newborns, including seizures, developmental delays, and immunodeficiency.

Given the patient's history of recurrent symptoms, pale skin, and hair, along with the presence of seizures, we would expect to see giant inclusion bodies in the peripheral blood smear due to CMV infection. This is a specific finding that can help diagnose congenital CMV infection.

The final answer is: C
