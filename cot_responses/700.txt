## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can start by analyzing each symptom to narrow down the possible diagnoses.

1. **Unwanted hair growth**: This could be related to hormonal imbalances or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but given the other symptoms, it's more likely related to an androgen excess state.
2. **Blackheads and pimples**: These are common skin issues that can be caused by hormonal fluctuations, particularly androgen excess.
3. **Deepening of the voice**: This symptom is often associated with hyperandrogenism or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as it can lead to an increase in dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
4. **Weight gain**: This could be related to hormonal imbalances, particularly androgen excess.
5. **Changes in external genitalia**: These are also consistent with PCOS, which is characterized by the presence of polycystic ovaries.

Considering these symptoms together, we can rule out some options:

- **C. Adrenocortical carcinoma** and **D. Granulosa cell tumour** are less likely due to their different symptom profiles (e.g., adrenal gland tumors typically present with hypertension, weight loss, or a distinctive "moon" sign on imaging).
- **B. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour** is also unlikely as it would more commonly present with virilization of male external genitalia rather than the female symptoms described.

Given these considerations, the most likely diagnosis is:

A. **Thecoma**: Thecomas are a type of sex cord-stromal tumor that can produce estrogen and androgen. They are often associated with PCOS and can cause hormonal imbalances leading to symptoms such as hirsutism (unwanted hair growth), acne, and virilization of female external genitalia.

Therefore, the answer is A.
