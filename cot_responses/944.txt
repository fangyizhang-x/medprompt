## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), depression, and chronic bilateral ear infections, it is essential to consider her symptoms in the context of these underlying conditions.

The patient reports occasional shooting pain with eating and when wearing earrings, which suggests a possible relationship between her oral cavity and her central nervous system. The fact that she experiences this pain in response to certain stimuli (eating and wearing earrings) is indicative of a condition that affects both the sensory nerves and the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for transmitting sensory information from the face to the brain.

The physical exam findings are also noteworthy. The absence of tenderness with preauricular or mandibular palpation bilaterally suggests that there may not be an obvious cause for her pain in these areas. However, the presence of right postauricular tapping causing tenderness in her right tonsillar area is a critical finding.

The patient's history of chronic bilateral ear infections and shooting pain with eating and wearing earrings could be related to a condition affecting the nerves that supply the ears or the trigeminal nerve. Given the location of the pain (tonsillar area), it is more likely that the condition affects the glossopharyngeal nerve, which is responsible for transmitting sensory information from the throat and tonsils.

The patient's symptoms are also consistent with glossopharyngeal neuralgia, a chronic pain disorder characterized by shooting or stabbing pains in the neck, ear, or throat. The fact that her molar teeth appear even and symmetric bilaterally suggests that there is no obvious cause for her pain in these areas, which further supports this diagnosis.

In contrast, atypical migraines typically present with more complex symptoms such as aura, photophobia, or phonophobia, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation. Cluster headaches are characterized by severe, one-sided pain, often accompanied by nasal congestion and tearing, which is not described in the patient's case. Trigeminal neuralgia typically presents with sharp, stabbing pains in the face, but these are usually localized to specific areas such as the cheek or forehead.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and history of underlying conditions, the most likely diagnosis is glossopharyngeal neuralgia.

The final answer is: C
