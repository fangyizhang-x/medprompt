The phenomenon that explains why this 1-year-old immigrant girl has not contracted any vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, diphtheria, or pertussis is herd immunity.

Firstly, let's define what herd immunity is. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, thereby preventing its spread and transmission to others. This can happen through vaccination, where a large enough proportion of the population receives vaccines, creating a barrier against the disease.

In this case, the 1-year-old girl has not received any recommended vaccines since birth, which means she is not immune to vaccine-preventable diseases. However, she attends daycare and remains healthy despite her association with several other children at home daycare facilities. This suggests that the children in these settings are likely vaccinated against common childhood diseases.

The presence of a sufficient number of vaccinated individuals in the community creates a barrier against the spread of disease. Since the girl is not immune to vaccine-preventable diseases, it's unlikely that she would contract them even if exposed to others who are vaccinated.

Therefore, herd immunity explains why this 1-year-old immigrant girl has not contracted any vaccine-preventable diseases despite her association with other children at daycare facilities.

The other options do not explain the phenomenon:

- Genetic drift refers to the random change in allele frequencies within a population over time.
- Tolerance is an immune response where the body tolerates a pathogen or antigen without mounting an immune response.
- Immune evasion is a mechanism by which pathogens evade the host's immune system, making it difficult for the immune system to respond effectively.
