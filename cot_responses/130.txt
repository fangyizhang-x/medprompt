## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 3-year-old girl, which includes multiple foul-smelling, bulky stools with flatulence every day for 6 months, failure to pass stool in the first 24 hours of life, greenish-black vomitus, abdominal distention immediately at birth that increased when eating or yawning, and similar symptoms in other family members, along with a history of significant abdominal distention during delivery, it is highly suggestive of Hirschsprung's disease. The fact that there was no remission after the procedure also supports this diagnosis.

The physical examination findings, including periumbilical and midepigastric tenderness to palpation without rebound tenderness or guarding, slight genu varum deformity, bony tenderness in her legs, foul-smelling flatulation, intact rectosphincteric reflex, decreased fecal elastase, and a negative D-xylose test, further support the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease.

Hirschsprung's disease is a congenital condition characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, leading to functional obstruction. The most common cause is genetic mutations that affect the gene encoding for the protein neuromuscular junction, which is necessary for the development and function of the enteric nervous system.

Given this diagnosis, the most appropriate long-term treatment would be rectal suction biopsy and surgical correction (Hirschsprung's procedure). This involves surgically removing a portion of the colon to relieve the obstruction caused by the absence of ganglion cells. The goal is to restore normal bowel function and alleviate symptoms.

The other options are not correct:

A. Enzyme-replacement therapy is used in conditions such as cystic fibrosis, where there is an issue with the production of enzymes necessary for digestion. It is not relevant to this case.

C. Duodenal atresia repair is a surgical procedure performed on infants with duodenal obstruction due to a congenital defect in the duodenum. While it may be considered in some cases of intestinal obstruction, it does not address the underlying cause of Hirschsprung's disease.

D. Cholecalciferol is a vitamin D analog used for treating rickets and other bone disorders. It has no relevance to this case.

Therefore, the answer is B.
