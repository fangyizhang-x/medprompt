## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's consider the key points from the scenario:

1. **Patient Profile**: A 71-year-old man with hypertension.
2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The point of maximal impulse is in the mid-axillary line, which suggests that the heart is enlarged and possibly hypertrophied.
3. **Echocardiogram Results**: Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with a normal right ventricle.

Given these points, we need to consider the underlying mechanisms of LVH:

- **A. Accumulation of glycogen**: While glycogen accumulation can contribute to cardiac hypertrophy, it is more commonly associated with conditions like diabetes or hyperinsulinemia.
- **B. Accumulation of protein fibrils**: This option refers to the process of myocardial fibrosis, which can occur in response to chronic hypertension and leads to concentric LVH. Myocardial fibrosis involves the deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix components, leading to an increase in ventricular wall thickness.
- **C. Accumulation of sarcomeres in parallel**: This option refers to a phenomenon known as "sarcomere shortening" or "sarcoplasmic remodeling," which can occur in response to chronic hypertension but is not the primary mechanism underlying concentric LVH.
- **D. Infiltration of T lymphocytes**: While immune responses, including those involving T lymphocytes, can contribute to cardiac disease, they are not a primary cause of concentric LVH.

Considering these points, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's ventricular hypertrophy is myocardial fibrosis, which is associated with chronic hypertension and leads to concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.

The final answer is: B
