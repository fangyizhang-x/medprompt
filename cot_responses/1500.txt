(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of worsening lower extremity pain that improves with rest, but worsens when walking, this is suggestive of intermittent claudication, a common symptom of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The presence of palpable distal pulses and coolness to the touch on the left lower extremity further supports this diagnosis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated triglycerides, which is consistent with hypertriglyceridemia. This condition can increase the risk of cardiovascular events, including PAD.

Considering the patient's medical history, family history, and current symptoms, we should focus on medications that not only treat her PAD but also address her hypertriglyceridemia and hypertension.

A. Aspirin only - While aspirin is a good starting point for preventing further clot formation in patients with PAD, it does not address the patient's elevated triglycerides or high LDL cholesterol levels.

B. Aspirin and atorvastatin - Atorvastatin is a statin that can help lower LDL cholesterol levels, which is beneficial for patients with hypertriglyceridemia. However, this option does not directly address the patient's hypertension.

C. Atorvastatin only - Similar to option B, atorvastatin alone may not be sufficient to manage the patient's elevated triglycerides and high LDL cholesterol levels.

D. Atorvastatin and cilostazol - Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor that can help improve blood flow to the legs by dilating blood vessels. It also has antiplatelet properties, which can be beneficial in patients with PAD who are at risk of thrombotic events.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate medication regimen for this patient would include atorvastatin to manage her hypertriglyceridemia and high LDL cholesterol levels, and cilostazol to improve blood flow and reduce symptoms of intermittent claudication. Aspirin can be added as a preventive measure against further clot formation.

## Answer Explanation
The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of PAD, which requires aggressive management of her hypertriglyceridemia and high LDL cholesterol levels. The addition of cilostazol to the regimen addresses both of these concerns. While aspirin provides antiplatelet effects, it does not directly address the patient's elevated triglycerides or high LDL cholesterol levels.
