## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, we can deduce that her symptoms are likely related to supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The fact that she has experienced palpitations before but they resolve spontaneously suggests that this may be a recurrent condition. Her recent onset while drinking coffee could also suggest a trigger.

The repeated forceful exhalation against a closed glottis while supine failed to relieve her symptoms is a classic maneuver for diagnosing SVT, as it can help identify the characteristic "sailboat" or "jet ski" rhythm that is often seen in this condition. However, given the patient's age and lack of other symptoms, we should also consider other causes of tachycardia.

The ECG findings are not explicitly described, but based on the context, it is likely that they show a narrow QRS complex with a rapid ventricular rate (tachycardia). The absence of other abnormalities on physical examination and the lack of symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pain make other diagnoses less likely.

Given these considerations, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. Administer adenosine intravenously - Adenosine is a first-line treatment for SVT because it can rapidly convert the tachycardia to a normal sinus rhythm. It works by transiently blocking AV node conduction, which allows the ventricles to fill more quickly and efficiently.

B. Administer verapamil intravenously - Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker that can be used to treat SVT, but it is not typically the first choice due to its potential for causing hypotension and other side effects.

C. Electrical cardioversion - This is a procedure where an electrical shock is applied to the heart to convert the tachycardia back to a normal rhythm. It is usually reserved for patients who are unstable or have failed other treatments.

D. Administer diltiazem intravenously - Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker that can be used to treat SVT, but it is not typically the first choice due to its potential for causing hypotension and other side effects.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate next step in management would be to administer adenosine intravenously to rapidly convert the tachycardia back to a normal rhythm. This is because adenosine has a high success rate for
