Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, we can deduce that his condition is likely a form of pseudogout or calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD), given the presence of joint inflammation, swelling, and tenderness. The key to solving this question lies in understanding the relationship between the patient's symptoms and potential predisposing factors.

Firstly, let's consider the patient's history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. While these conditions are important for overall cardiovascular health, they are not directly related to the development of CPPD or pseudogout.

Next, we examine the patient's recent medical history. The episode of diarrhea 3 weeks ago is notable because it resolved without treatment, which might initially suggest a gastrointestinal infection as a predisposing factor. However, this does not directly relate to the current knee symptoms.

The patient's brother has ankylosing spondylitis, a form of arthritis that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints. While there is a familial component to some forms of arthritis, it is not directly relevant to the patient's current condition.

Regarding the patient's history of recent alcohol consumption (1-2 ounces daily), moderate drinking can increase the risk of developing CPPD or pseudogout due to its effect on calcium metabolism and kidney function. However, this factor alone does not explain the patient's symptoms.

The examination findings are crucial here. The presence of a local skin abrasion below the patella is a key finding that points towards a specific diagnosis: pseudogout. Pseudogout is characterized by the sudden onset of joint pain and swelling due to the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals within the joint space.

The microscopic examination of the synovial fluid under polarized light shows rhomboid-shaped, weakly positively birefringent crystals. This finding is diagnostic for CPPD or pseudogout, as these crystals are characteristic of this condition.

Considering all the above points, the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition appears to be his recent alcohol consumption, particularly moderate drinking. While other factors such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia may also play a role in the development of CPPD or pseudogout, they are not as directly related to the current symptoms.

Therefore, the answer is A. Dyslipidemia.
