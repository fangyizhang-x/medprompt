## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms of generalized fatigue, cramping lower abdominal pain, diarrhea that is occasionally bloody, and rectal examination findings of stool mixed with blood, along with a history of colon cancer in his father, the most likely diagnosis is colorectal cancer. The presence of dry mucous membranes, slight tenderness to palpation over the lower quadrants bilaterally, and hemoglobin concentration of 13.5 g/dL are also indicative of significant gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's smoking history increases his risk for colorectal cancer, but it does not directly explain the current symptoms. The physical examination findings further support the diagnosis of colorectal cancer.

A colonoscopy is the most appropriate next step in management because it allows for direct visualization of the colon and rectum, which can confirm the presence of colorectal cancer, assess for any other abnormalities such as polyps or tumors, and collect tissue samples for histopathological examination. Flexible sigmoidoscopy may not be sufficient to diagnose colorectal cancer, especially if the disease is located in the lower part of the colon.

The D-xylose absorption test is used to evaluate malabsorption of carbohydrates, which can occur in various gastrointestinal disorders but is not directly related to this patient's symptoms and history. The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast may be useful for staging colorectal cancer or detecting any metastatic disease, but it does not address the immediate need to confirm the diagnosis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is a colonoscopy to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal tract and diagnose any potential colorectal cancer.
