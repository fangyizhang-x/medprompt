## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the information provided, we can deduce that the child's exposure to sunlight is likely due to a lack of sun protection rather than an external factor like child abuse or ionizing radiation.

Firstly, the fact that the child has fair skin and blond hair makes them more susceptible to burning from UV radiation. This is because people with lighter skin types have less melanin, which acts as a natural sunscreen, making them more vulnerable to UV damage.

The presence of burns on sun-exposed areas such as the face (especially the ears and nose), dorsal aspect of the hands, shoulders, and dorsal aspect of his feet suggests that the child has been exposed to direct sunlight. The fact that these areas are not typically protected by clothing or hats further supports this conclusion.

Considering the options provided:

A. Infrared radiation - While infrared radiation can cause burns, it is less likely to be the primary cause in this scenario given the child's fair skin and lack of protective measures.

B. Child abuse - There is no indication that the child has been physically abused or neglected, so this option can be ruled out.

C. UV-B radiation - This is the most likely etiology for the burns. UV-B radiation is a known cause of sunburns, and its intensity increases with altitude and in areas closer to the equator. Given the child's fair skin and lack of protective measures, it is highly probable that they have been exposed to excessive UV-B radiation.

D. Ionizing radiation - This option can be ruled out as there is no indication that the child has been exposed to ionizing radiation, such as from a nuclear accident or medical treatment.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the analysis of the options, the most likely etiology for the burns in this case is UV-B radiation.
