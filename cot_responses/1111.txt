## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Facial weakness**: The patient reports that his face appears twisted when looking in the bathroom mirror, which suggests a unilateral facial weakness. This is a key finding.

2. **Difficulty shutting the right eye tight and inability to bring up the right corner of his mouth when asked to smile**: These specific symptoms are indicative of a problem with the muscles responsible for eyelid closure (superior tarsal muscle) and smiling (zygomaticus major muscle). This further supports the idea that the weakness is unilateral.

3. **Remainder of the exam, including the left side of the face, is unremarkable**: The fact that the left side of his face is normal suggests that the problem may not be localized to one hemisphere of the brain or one side of the body.

4. **No significant past medical history and afebrile**: This reduces the likelihood of infectious causes for his symptoms.

5. **Neurological examination reveals difficulty shutting the right eye tight and inability to bring up the right corner of his mouth when asked to smile**: These findings are consistent with a problem affecting the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), which controls these muscles.

Considering these points, let's evaluate the options:

- A. Idiopathic facial paralysis: This condition is characterized by sudden onset of unilateral facial weakness without any identifiable cause. It can be idiopathic or result from trauma, infection, or other conditions. Given the patient's age and lack of past medical history, this seems a plausible diagnosis.

- B. Right hemisphere stroke: A right hemisphere stroke would likely affect both sides of the face equally, which is not consistent with the patient's unilateral symptoms.

- C. Acoustic neuroma: This is a benign tumor that affects the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII), leading to balance and hearing problems, respectively. It does not typically cause facial weakness or paralysis.

- D. Left middle cerebral artery stroke: A left-sided stroke would likely affect both sides of the face equally, which contradicts the patient's unilateral symptoms.

Given the analysis above, the most likely diagnosis is idiopathic facial paralysis, as it best explains the patient's unilateral facial weakness without any identifiable cause.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$
