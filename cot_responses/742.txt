To determine which option will offer the longest anesthesia for laceration repair, we need to consider the properties of each local anesthetic and its potential effects on bleeding.

1. **Lidocaine (C)**: Lidocaine is a short-acting local anesthetic with a duration of action that typically ranges from 30 minutes to 2 hours. It may not provide sufficient anesthesia for a laceration repair, especially if the patient has significant bleeding or if the wound is large.

2. **Lidocaine with epinephrine (D)**: The addition of epinephrine to lidocaine increases its duration of action by constricting blood vessels near the injection site. This effect can prolong the anesthesia time, making it a more suitable option for longer procedures like laceration repair.

3. **Bupivacaine (A)** and **Bupivacaine with epinephrine (B)**: Both bupivacaine are long-acting local anesthetics that provide significant pain relief but may not be as effective in reducing bleeding due to their vasoconstrictive properties.

Considering the need for prolonged anesthesia to manage a laceration repair, especially one involving significant bleeding like this case, **Bupivacaine with epinephrine (B)** would offer the longest anesthesia. This combination provides both adequate pain relief and effective hemostasis, making it more suitable for longer procedures requiring significant anesthesia.

The final answer is: B
