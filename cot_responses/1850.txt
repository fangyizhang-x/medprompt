## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine the direct mechanism of action of sitagliptin, let's first understand what it is used for and its general pharmacological class.

Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. DPP-4 inhibitors are a class of oral antidiabetic medications that work by inhibiting the enzyme DPP-4, which is involved in the inactivation of incretin hormones. Incretins are hormones produced in the intestines that stimulate insulin release in response to food intake and decrease glucagon levels.

Given this background, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. Inhibits degradation of endogenous incretins - This action is more closely associated with GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists, which are a different class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin does not primarily work by inhibiting the degradation of endogenous incretin hormones.

B. Inhibits alpha-glucosidases at the intestinal brush border - This action is associated with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, which delay carbohydrate absorption and are typically used in combination with other medications to manage diabetes. Sitagliptin does not primarily work by inhibiting alpha-glucosidases.

C. Activates transcription of PPARs to increase peripheral sensitivity to insulin - This action is more closely associated with thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are a class of medications used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin does not primarily work by activating transcription of PPARs.

D. Increases secretion of insulin in response to oral glucose loads and delays gastric emptying - This action is characteristic of DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin. By inhibiting DPP-4, sitagliptin increases the levels of incretin hormones (e.g., GLP-1) in the circulation, which in turn stimulates insulin secretion from the pancreas in response to oral glucose loads and delays gastric emptying.

Therefore, based on the mechanism of action of sitagliptin as a DPP-4 inhibitor, the correct answer is:

The final model answer is: D
