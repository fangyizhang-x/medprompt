## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine the spatial distribution of CD117-positive cells in biopsy specimens, we need a method that can accurately identify and localize these cells within the tissue.

Firstly, let's consider each option:

A. Flow cytometry: This is a technique used to analyze the physical and chemical characteristics of particles or cells as they pass through a laser beam. While flow cytometry can be used to detect CD117-positive cells, it typically requires prior staining and sorting of cells, which may not provide detailed spatial information.

B. Immunohistochemistry (IHC): This is a laboratory technique that uses antibodies to identify specific proteins in tissue sections. IHC can help localize CD117-positive cells within the tissue, but its resolution is limited to the area where the antibody binds, and it may not be able to distinguish between different cell types.

C. Northern blot: This is a laboratory technique used to detect and quantify RNA molecules in a sample. It is not suitable for detecting proteins like CD117, which are typically found on the surface of cells.

D. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH): This is a molecular cytogenetic technique that uses fluorescent probes to visualize specific DNA sequences within cells. FISH can be used to detect and localize CD117-positive cells with high resolution, allowing for detailed spatial information about their distribution within the tissue.

Given the need for accurate localization of CD117-positive cells in biopsy specimens, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) is the most appropriate test among the options provided.

## Answer Explanation:
The question requires identifying the most suitable method for determining the spatial distribution of CD117-positive cells in biopsy specimens. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry are both useful techniques, but they have limitations when it comes to providing detailed spatial information about cell localization. Northern blot is not applicable due to its focus on RNA detection. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), on the other hand, offers high-resolution imaging of specific DNA sequences within cells, making it an ideal choice for detecting and localizing CD117-positive cells with precision.

Therefore, the answer is D.
