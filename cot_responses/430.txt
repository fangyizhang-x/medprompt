## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's age, symptoms, and lack of family or personal history of serious illness, we can initially consider several common causes of knee pain in young adults.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option:

A. Chondrosarcoma: This is a type of bone cancer that typically affects older adults, particularly those over 50 years old. It is less likely to be the primary diagnosis given the patient's age and lack of family history.

B. Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC): ABCs are common in young people, often presenting with painless swelling of the bone. However, they typically do not cause significant pain or limited range of motion until later stages. The x-ray findings might show a lytic lesion, but this is not mentioned in the question.

C. Osteoclastoma (Giant Cell Tumor): This tumor is more common in adults and adolescents, often presenting with painless swelling of the bone. It typically affects weight-bearing bones like the knee. Given the patient's age and symptoms, osteoclastoma seems a plausible diagnosis.

D. Ewing sarcoma: This is another type of bone cancer that can occur in young people, but it is more aggressive than osteoclastoma and often presents with systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or night sweats. The question does not mention any systemic symptoms, making this less likely.

Considering the patient's age, symptoms, and lack of family history, osteoclastoma (Giant Cell Tumor) is the most likely diagnosis. This tumor typically affects young adults and can cause painless swelling of the bone, which matches the patient's presentation.
