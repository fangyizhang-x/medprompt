## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, particularly the spontaneous drainage of blood-tinged fluid from both nostrils and its worsening with leaning forward, this scenario is highly suggestive of a nasal hematoma.

The key points to consider:

1. **Spontaneous drainage**: This indicates that the pressure within the nasal cavity has decreased, which can occur due to bleeding into the nasal passages.
2. **Worsening with leaning forward**: This position increases intrathoracic pressure, which can cause blood to shift from the head and neck down towards the thorax, exacerbating any existing nasal or sinus bleeding.

Considering these points:

- Cranial nerve XII (hypothesis A) is not directly related to this scenario. While cranial nerves are involved in various aspects of facial function, the symptoms described do not specifically suggest a problem with one of these nerves.
  
- Bilateral periorbital ecchymosis (B) could be a sign of increased pressure within the skull or intracranial hemorrhage but is less directly related to the nasal drainage described.

- Numbness of the upper cheek area (C) might suggest involvement of cranial nerves V, VII, IX, or X, which are responsible for facial sensation. However, this symptom does not align with the primary presentation of a nasal hematoma.

- Retroauricular ecchymosis (D) is indicative of bleeding behind the ear, typically due to trauma or injury to the temporal bone. While possible in the context of a head injury, it does not directly relate to the symptoms described for this patient.

Given the information provided and focusing on the key points that point towards a nasal hematoma, the most likely answer is related to the increased pressure within the nasal cavity exacerbating bleeding from an existing laceration or trauma. Therefore:

The final answer is: D
