## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The clinical presentation of this 18-month-old girl, including failure to thrive, developmental delay, restricted movement, coarse facial features, and increased plasma levels of several enzymes, is highly suggestive of a lysosomal storage disorder. The key findings that point towards a specific biochemical defect are:

1. **Increased plasma levels of several enzymes**: This suggests an accumulation of certain enzymes or their precursors in the body, which is characteristic of lysosomal storage diseases.
2. **Coarse facial features and restricted joint mobility**: These physical examination findings can be associated with various genetic disorders, but in the context of a lysosomal storage disease, they are particularly suggestive of conditions that affect muscle and skeletal development.
3. **Failure to thrive and developmental delay**: These symptoms indicate a systemic impact on growth and development.

Given these clues, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Failure of mannose phosphorylation**: This is related to the metabolism of glycoproteins and glycolipids, which are not directly implicated in this clinical presentation.

B. **Inappropriate degradation of lysosomal enzymes**: This choice aligns with the increased plasma levels of several enzymes observed in the patient. Lysosomal storage diseases result from deficiencies or mutations in genes encoding for lysosomal enzymes, leading to their inappropriate degradation and accumulation within lysosomes.

C. **Congenital lack of lysosomal formation**: While this option might seem plausible, it does not directly explain the clinical findings related to enzyme accumulation and physical examination abnormalities.

D. **Misfolding of nuclear proteins**: This choice is more relevant to neurodegenerative diseases or disorders affecting protein synthesis rather than a lysosomal storage disease.

Based on the analysis above, the most likely underlying biochemical defect in this patient is an inappropriate degradation of lysosomal enzymes, which would lead to their accumulation within cells and tissues, causing the observed clinical symptoms.

The final answer is: B
