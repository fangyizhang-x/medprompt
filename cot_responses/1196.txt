## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To solve this question, let's consider the pathophysiology of an allergic reaction, which is what appears to be happening in this scenario.

1. **Innate Immunity**: The initial response to an insect bite involves the activation of innate immunity, primarily through the release of cytokines and chemokines from immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages.

2. **Cytokine Release**: Among these cytokines, Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is known for its role in activating macrophages and enhancing their ability to kill ingested pathogens. However, it also has a secondary effect of promoting the release of other cytokines that contribute to the allergic response.

3. **Histamine Release**: Histamine is a key mediator released from mast cells upon activation by IgE antibodies bound to FcεRI receptors on these cells. It plays a crucial role in the development of allergic inflammation, including the symptoms observed at the site of the insect bite (swelling and redness).

4. **Allergic Reaction Pathway**: The direct consequence of IFN-γ's action is the upregulation of histamine receptors on mast cells, leading to increased release of histamine. This results in the wheal formation characteristic of an allergic reaction.

5. **Conclusion**: Given that Histamine is directly involved in the pathogenesis of the symptoms observed after the insect bite (swelling and redness), it has led to the wheal formation.

The final answer is: B
