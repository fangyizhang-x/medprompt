Given the patient's concerns about her risk for breast cancer, it is essential to consider both genetic and lifestyle factors that contribute to this disease.

Firstly, the patient's family history of breast cancer through her mother is a significant concern. However, BRCA1 and 2 mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning only one copy of the mutated gene is needed for the condition to occur. The patient's mother died of breast cancer at age 90, which suggests that the patient may not be at high risk based solely on her family history.

The patient's current lifestyle factors include smoking (1 pack per day), moderate alcohol consumption (2-3 glasses per day), and a relatively low intake of fruits and vegetables. These factors are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but they do not significantly increase the risk compared to other factors such as genetic mutations or obesity.

Given these considerations, the best recommendation for this patient is to **D. Exercise and reduce alcohol intake**. Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce inflammation, all of which are beneficial for breast cancer prevention. Reducing alcohol consumption is also important because moderate alcohol use has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.

Breastfeeding (A) may not be the most effective way to reduce breast cancer risk in this patient, as there is limited evidence that breastfeeding significantly reduces the risk of breast cancer. Testing for BRCA1 and 2 (B) is a genetic test that can provide information about an individual's risk of developing certain types of breast cancer, but it is not typically recommended as a first-line prevention strategy.

Monthly self-breast exams (C) are generally recommended for women with a family history of breast cancer or those who have had breast cancer themselves. However, this patient has no complaints and her current lifestyle factors do not suggest that she would benefit from more frequent self-exams.

Therefore, the best recommendation is to encourage the patient to engage in regular physical activity and reduce her alcohol intake to help maintain a healthy lifestyle and potentially reduce her risk of breast cancer.
