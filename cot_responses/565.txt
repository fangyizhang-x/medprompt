## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation with fatigue, headache, dry cough, mild inspiratory crackles in both lung fields on chest examination, diffuse interstitial infiltrates bilaterally on X-ray, and the Gram stain showing no organisms, the most likely diagnosis is Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). PCP is a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV/AIDS or undergoing chemotherapy.

The finding of yeast-like colonies resembling fried eggs on cell-free medium that is enriched with yeast extract, horse serum, cholesterol, and penicillin G growing on inoculation suggests the presence of Pneumocystis jirovecii. This organism is sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), which is a first-line treatment for PCP.

Considering the patient's age (27 years) and the fact that she does not smoke or use illicit drugs, it is unlikely that her PCP is caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). MAC is more commonly associated with immunocompromised individuals who have undergone chemotherapy or are HIV-positive.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate intravenous TMP-SMX as a single agent treatment for PCP. This will help to rapidly control the infection and prevent its progression to more severe forms such as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) or pneumonia.

Intravenous ceftriaxone may be used in combination with TMP-SMX for patients who are allergic to TMP-SMX or have a history of MAC infection, but this is not necessary given the patient's presentation and the likely diagnosis of PCP. Oral amoxicillin would not be sufficient as a single agent treatment for PCP due to its limited efficacy against Pneumocystis jirovecii.

In addition, oral azithromycin may also be used in combination with TMP-SMX for patients who are allergic to TMP-SMX or have a history of MAC infection, but this is not necessary given the patient's presentation and the likely diagnosis of PCP.
