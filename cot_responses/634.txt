Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is peripheral arterial disease (PAD), specifically a critical limb ischemia (CLI) due to severe stenosis or occlusion in the right femoral artery. The presence of severe pain, coolness, and diminished pulses in the right lower extremity, combined with the patient's history of smoking and hypertension, strongly supports this diagnosis.

The patient's inability to walk 200 meters without stopping is a significant concern, as it indicates severe PAD that is likely causing ischemia or infarction. The fact that she can continue to walk after a break of around 5 minutes suggests that the disease process is not yet advanced enough to cause significant compromise of her walking ability.

Considering the patient's medical history and current symptoms, the most appropriate next step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis through imaging studies that can provide detailed information about the arterial anatomy and pathology. Duplex ultrasonography (A) is a non-invasive, cost-effective, and widely available test that can evaluate the blood flow and morphology of the arteries. It is particularly useful for assessing PAD and CLI.

Nerve conduction studies (B) may be helpful in evaluating the function of the nerves innervating the affected limb, but they are not typically used as a first-line diagnostic tool for PAD or CLI.

Ankle-brachial index (C) can provide information about the severity of PAD, but it is not specific and cannot distinguish between stenosis and occlusion.

Biopsy of the tibial artery (D) is an invasive procedure that carries significant risks and is not typically used as a diagnostic tool for PAD or CLI. It may be considered in certain cases where imaging studies are inconclusive or when there is a need to evaluate the arterial wall for specific pathological changes.

Therefore, Duplex ultrasonography (A) is the most appropriate next step in management, as it provides a comprehensive evaluation of the arterial anatomy and pathology, which can help guide further treatment decisions.
