## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and history, we can deduce that he is experiencing a new stroke, specifically affecting the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). The facial nerve controls muscles of facial expression, including those on the right side of the face. Weakness or drooping of this side would indicate an issue with the motor function controlled by the facial nerve.

The patient's history of shingles treated with acyclovir and a stroke 10 years ago is relevant because it suggests that he may have had herpes zoster (shingles) in the past, which can cause Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2. This condition is characterized by facial paralysis (drooping of the face), ear pain, and sometimes hearing loss.

The symptoms described are consistent with Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2, which typically presents with:

- Facial weakness or drooping on one side
- Ear pain
- Hearing loss in the affected ear

Given this information, we can expect to see additional findings that are characteristic of Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2. The options provided can be evaluated as follows:

A. Decreased salivation - This is not a typical finding in Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2.
B. Partial hearing loss - While hearing loss can occur in some cases, it's not the most specific or common finding for this condition.
C. Complete loss of taste to the tongue - Taste disturbances are not typically associated with Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2.
D. Wrinkled forehead - This is a classic sign of Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2, as the facial nerve can cause changes in the skin on the forehead.

Therefore, the most likely additional finding would be wrinkled forehead (D), which is a characteristic feature of this condition.
