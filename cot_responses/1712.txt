## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III heart failure and current medications, we need to consider additional treatments that can help manage his symptoms and improve his quality of life.

Firstly, let's review the patient's current medications:

- Captopril is an ACE inhibitor, which helps reduce blood pressure and alleviate symptoms of heart failure.
- Furosemide is a diuretic, which can help reduce fluid buildup in the body and relieve congestion.
- Potassium chloride is used to manage hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels), but it's not directly related to heart failure management.
- Rosuvastatin is a statin, which helps lower cholesterol levels and reduce cardiovascular risk.
- Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that reduces the risk of blood clots.

Considering these medications, we can evaluate the options:

A. Losartan - An angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), which can help reduce blood pressure and alleviate symptoms of heart failure. However, it may not be necessary as a first-line treatment for NYHA class III heart failure.

B. Metoprolol tartrate - A beta-blocker that can help reduce heart rate, blood pressure, and symptoms of heart failure. Beta-blockers are often recommended for patients with heart failure, especially those with reduced ejection fraction (e.g., NYHA class II-III).

C. Metoprolol succinate - A longer-acting form of metoprolol tartrate, which can provide sustained beta-blockade and reduce symptoms of heart failure.

D. Digoxin - A cardiac glycoside that can help increase contractility and reduce symptoms of heart failure. However, it's typically used in patients with atrial fibrillation or other conditions where digoxin is contraindicated.

Given the patient's NYHA class III heart failure and current medications, adding a beta-blocker (B) would be an appropriate addition to his regimen. Beta-blockers can help reduce symptoms of heart failure, improve exercise tolerance, and reduce mortality risk in patients with heart failure.

Therefore, the final answer is B. Metoprolol tartrate.
