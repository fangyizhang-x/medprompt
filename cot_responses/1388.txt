## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Symptoms**: The boy presents with right-sided shoulder pain for 1 day without fever or chills, which suggests a non-infectious cause.
2. **Past medical history**: He has had painful swelling of his hands and feet twice in the past year, which could indicate a chronic condition such as sickle cell disease (SCD) or other hemolytic anemias.
3. **Physical examination findings**: The absence of tenderness, erythema, or joint swelling on the shoulder suggests that the pain is likely related to his current symptoms rather than a localized infection or inflammatory process.
4. **Laboratory studies**:
   - **Hemoglobin (Hb) 7 g/dL**: This is significantly below the normal range for adult males (12-16 g/dL), indicating anemia.
   - **Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 88 Î¼m**: This is within the normal range, suggesting that the anemia is not due to a macrocytic or microcytic disorder.
   - **Reticulocyte count 9%**: This is elevated, indicating increased bone marrow activity and production of new red blood cells. This finding is consistent with an acute stress response, such as pain or inflammation.
   - **Leukocyte count 12,000/mm3**: This is within the normal range for adult males.

Considering these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a hemolytic anemia, specifically **Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)**. The presence of painful swelling in the hands and feet, along with the laboratory evidence of increased reticulocyte count and anemia, supports this conclusion.

Given the patient's history of painful swelling in his hands and feet, which is a classic symptom of SCD, it is likely that he has sickle cell disease. The peripheral blood smear would most likely show **fragmentation of erythrocytes**, also known as schistocytes, due to the abnormal shape of red blood cells caused by the sickling process.

Therefore, the answer is C. Fragmentation of erythrocytes.
