## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history of small cell lung carcinoma, his current chemotherapy regimen (demeclocycline and amoxicillin), and his symptoms of a painful, burning red rash on his face and hands after exposure to sunlight, we can consider several potential causes. However, considering the context of his cancer treatment and the specific nature of his symptoms, we need to evaluate each option carefully.

Firstly, let's rule out some options based on the information provided:

- Option B (Systemic lupus erythematosus) is less likely because while it can cause skin rashes, they are typically more widespread and not limited to the face and hands in this case.
- Option D (Normal sunburn reaction) might seem plausible given his history of occasional sunburns, but the pattern of the rash and its association with sunlight exposure suggest a more specific condition.

This leaves us with options A (Uroporphyrin accumulation), C (Use of demeclocycline), and D (Normal sunburn reaction). Let's evaluate these:

- Option A (Uroporphyrin accumulation) is associated with porphyria cutanea tarda, a condition that can cause skin blistering and erythema. However, it typically presents with more widespread skin changes and is not specifically linked to sunlight exposure.
  
- Option C (Use of demeclocycline) is known to cause photosensitivity, which manifests as a sunburn-like reaction in some patients. This is due to the drug's ability to induce porphyrin accumulation in the skin, leading to an exaggerated response to ultraviolet light.

Given this information and considering the patient's history of cancer treatment, the most likely cause of his symptoms is related to demeclocycline use.

The final answer is: C
