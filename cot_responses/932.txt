The patient's history and current Pap test results suggest that she has a low-grade dysplasia, which is a precursor to cervical cancer. The presence of atypical glandular cells with reactive changes on the colposcopy indicates that there may be some residual abnormality in the cervix.

Given this information, the next best step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any potential progression to invasive cancer. A biopsy is not sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis, as it only provides an assessment of cellular changes. Therefore, a more definitive diagnostic procedure is needed.

Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) is a suitable option for this patient because it allows for the removal of abnormal tissue while minimizing the risk of spreading cancer cells. This procedure can be performed under local anesthesia and typically takes about 30 minutes to an hour to complete.

Cold Knife Conization, on the other hand, involves removing a cone-shaped sample of tissue from the cervix using a cold knife. While it is a less invasive procedure than LEEP, it may not provide as clear a diagnosis in cases where there are multiple areas of abnormality or when the extent of the disease is uncertain.

Following up with a Pap smear in one year (Option C) would be inappropriate given the patient's history and current findings. A Pap smear can detect changes that have already progressed to dysplasia, but it does not provide a definitive diagnosis.

Following up with a Pap smear in three years (Option D) is also not appropriate as the risk of progression to invasive cancer increases over time, especially in patients with low-grade dysplasia.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient would be to perform a Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP).
