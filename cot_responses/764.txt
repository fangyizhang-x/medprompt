Given the clinical presentation of this 7-year-old boy, we can deduce that he has a bacterial pharyngitis with complications such as a whitish membrane on the tonsil and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. The presence of a coated tongue, red uvula, and fever suggests an upper respiratory tract infection.

The patient's history of similar episodes in the past, which were treated with amoxicillin but resulted in adverse reactions (skin rash and facial swelling), raises concerns about antibiotic resistance. Therefore, we need to consider alternative antibiotics that are effective against Streptococcus pyogenes, the likely causative organism.

Option A, Penicillin V, is a reasonable choice as it is an oral penicillin that can be used for treating bacterial pharyngitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. It has been shown to be effective in reducing the duration and severity of symptoms, as well as preventing complications such as rheumatic fever.

Option B, Total tonsillectomy, may be considered if the patient has recurrent infections or if there are other indications for removal of the tonsils (e.g., sleep apnea). However, this is not the next most appropriate step in management without further evaluation and consideration of alternative treatments.

Option C, Fluconazole, is an antifungal medication that would be more appropriate for treating fungal infections such as candidiasis. There is no indication in the patient's presentation to suggest a fungal infection.

Option D, Erythromycin, is a macrolide antibiotic that may be used for treating certain bacterial infections, but it is not typically the first choice for streptococcal pharyngitis due to concerns about resistance and side effects.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and history, the next most appropriate step in management would be to prescribe Penicillin V.
