## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's analyze the clinical presentation and laboratory findings in the newborn.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The newborn presents with vomiting, hyperventilation, lethargy, seizures, hyperammonemia, elevated glutamine levels, decreased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and cerebral edema on CT scan. These symptoms suggest a metabolic disorder affecting the nervous system and possibly the liver.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: Hyperammonemia is indicative of an amino acid or ketoacidosis issue. Elevated glutamine levels can be seen in disorders that affect the urea cycle, such as carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) deficiency. Decreased BUN suggests impaired renal function.

3. **Metabolic Pathways**: The key to this question lies in understanding which metabolic pathways are crucial for ammonia detoxification and urea cycle function.

   - A. Phenylalanine hydroxylase is involved in the metabolism of phenylalanine, not directly related to ammonia or urea cycle disorders.
   
   - B. Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKD) is part of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and is crucial for the conversion of branched-chain amino acids into their keto-acids. While it's involved in energy metabolism, its deficiency primarily affects the breakdown of these amino acids.
   
   - C. Cystathionine synthase is an enzyme that participates in the transsulfuration pathway, converting homocysteine to cystathionine and methionine to cysteine. It's not directly involved in ammonia detoxification or urea cycle function.
   
   - D. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) is a key enzyme in the urea cycle, catalyzing the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia and bicarbonate. A deficiency in CPSI leads to hyperammonemia.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely defect that would result in this infant's symptoms is a deficiency in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI), which is essential for ammonia detoxification through the urea cycle.

The final answer is: D
