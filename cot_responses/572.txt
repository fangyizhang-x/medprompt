## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, which includes severe abdominal pain radiating to the right scapula, tenderness in the epigastrium, and inspiratory arrest during palpation of the right upper quadrant but not the left, we can deduce that the blockage is likely located at the level of the cystic duct or the ampulla of Vater. Here's a step-by-step thought process:

1. **Radiating pain**: The patient's pain radiates to the right scapula, which suggests that the pain is originating from a structure in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) rather than the left.

2. **Tenderness in epigastrium and RUQ**: Tenderness in these areas indicates inflammation or irritation of structures within the RUQ.

3. **Inspiratory arrest during palpation**: This finding suggests that the blockage is likely located near a major duct that connects the gallbladder to the bile ducts, as this would cause an obstruction when trying to palpate it with deep breaths due to its proximity to the diaphragm and the position of the patient.

4. **Possible locations for the blockage**:
   - A. Common hepatic duct: This duct drains bile from the liver into the cystic duct, which then connects to the gallbladder. However, it's less likely given the location of the pain and tenderness.
   - B. Ampulla of Vater: The ampulla is a major junction where the common hepatic duct and cystic duct merge. It's located near the junction between the right and left hepatic ducts, which could explain the inspiratory arrest during palpation due to its proximity to the diaphragm.
   - C. Cystic duct: While this duct connects the gallbladder to the common bile duct, it's less likely given the location of the pain and tenderness in the RUQ.
   - D. Pancreatic duct of Wirsung: This duct is involved in pancreatic secretions and is not directly related to the symptoms described.

Considering these factors, the most likely location for the blockage causing this patientâ€™s symptoms is near the ampulla of Vater, which connects the common hepatic duct (or cystic duct) with the bile ducts. The inspiratory arrest during palpation due to its proximity to the diaphragm and the position of the patient supports
