To determine the most appropriate statistical analysis for this study, let's consider the research question and the types of data involved.

The study aims to find an association between serum cholesterol levels and ischemic heart disease, as well as between serum cholesterol levels and experiencing stable angina. This suggests that we are looking at a relationship between two categorical variables (cholesterol levels and angina experience).

Given this context, let's evaluate the options:

A. Attributable risk: This measure is used to estimate the proportion of disease incidence that can be attributed to a particular exposure or risk factor. While it could provide some insight into the association between cholesterol levels and heart disease, it doesn't directly address the relationship between angina experience.

B. Chi-squared test: This statistical test is commonly used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. It can be used to compare the observed frequencies of different categories in one or more variables against expected frequencies under a null hypothesis of no association. Given that we have two independent categorical variables (cholesterol levels and angina experience), a Chi-squared test would be an appropriate choice.

C. Pearson correlation: This statistical measure is used to calculate the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. While it could provide some insight into the relationship between serum cholesterol levels and angina experience, it doesn't address categorical data or associations between different categories.

D. T-test: This statistical test is used to compare the means of two groups to determine if there is a significant difference between them. It's typically used when we have continuous data and want to compare the means of two groups. Since this study involves categorical variables, a T-test would not be appropriate.

Therefore, considering the research question and the types of data involved, the most appropriate statistical analysis for this study is the Chi-squared test.
