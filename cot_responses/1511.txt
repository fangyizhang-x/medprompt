## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Step 1: Assess the patient's current mental health status
The patient has been prescribed escitalopram, an SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor), which is commonly used to treat depression. However, he expresses increased desire to carry out suicidal thoughts and hospitalization for a brief course of treatment.

### Step 2: Consider the risks associated with continuing antidepressant medication during surgery
Escitalopram can increase the risk of bleeding when taken with other medications that affect platelet function or blood clotting. This is particularly concerning in the context of elective surgery, where the patient's physical condition may be compromised.

### Step 3: Evaluate the potential benefits and risks of continuing escitalopram on the day of surgery
While the patient reports feeling better and not wanting to take escitalopram every day, there are concerns about the risk of bleeding during surgery. Continuing the medication on the day of surgery could increase this risk.

### Step 4: Consider alternative treatment options for depression in the perioperative period
Given the risks associated with continuing escitalopram on the day of surgery, alternative treatment options should be explored. These might include switching to a different antidepressant or adjusting the dosage or timing of the medication.

### Step 5: Choose the most appropriate response based on the analysis
Considering the potential risks and benefits, discontinuing escitalopram is the most appropriate response. This allows for careful monitoring of the patient's mental health status during surgery while minimizing the risk of bleeding complications.

The final answer is: B
