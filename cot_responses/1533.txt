To approach this question, let's consider the patient's medical history and symptoms.

1. **Crohn's disease**: This is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but most commonly affects the terminal ileum and the beginning of the colon. It can cause chronic inflammation, which may lead to various systemic complications, including fatigue and headaches due to malabsorption of nutrients.

2. **Symptoms**: The patient is experiencing headaches and fatigue. These symptoms are non-specific but can be related to malnutrition or anemia, both of which can be consequences of chronic disease like Crohn's.

3. **Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis**: ABG measures the levels of oxygen in the blood, carbon dioxide (CO2), and the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). The normal range for PaO2 is approximately 75-100 mmHg, with a normal SaO2 being above 95% and CaO2 being between 35-45 mmol/L.

Given these considerations:

- **Option A** is incorrect because Crohn's disease can lead to malabsorption of nutrients, which would result in low levels of oxygen (CaO2) rather than normal levels.
  
- **Option B** is the most likely choice. Low PaO2 indicates hypoxemia, and low SaO2 further supports this diagnosis as it suggests inadequate oxygenation of the blood. The low CaO2 level also aligns with the expected consequences of malabsorption in Crohn's disease.

- **Option C** is incorrect because normal levels of PaO2 would not be expected given the patient's symptoms and the likely presence of hypoxemia.

- **Option D** is incorrect for similar reasons as Option A; low CaO2 does not align with the expected consequences of malabsorption in Crohn's disease.

Therefore, considering the patient's history of Crohn's disease and her current symptoms of headaches and fatigue, the most likely arterial blood finding would be a low PaO2, low SaO2, and normal CaO2 levels.
