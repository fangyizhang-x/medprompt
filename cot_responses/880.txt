## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, we can analyze the possible causes step by step:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with pain, redness, blurry vision, difficulty opening his eyes in bright surroundings, and recent contact lens use. These symptoms are suggestive of an inflammatory or infectious process affecting the eye.

2. **History**: The patient has a history of penetrating trauma to one eye 6 months ago, which could have led to post-traumatic glaucoma (PTG). However, PTG typically presents with increased intraocular pressure (IOP) rather than decreased vision and blurred vision as primary symptoms.

3. **Physical examination findings**:
   - Congestion of the perilimbal conjunctivae bilaterally suggests an inflammatory process.
   - Decreased visual acuity bilaterally indicates a problem affecting the eye's ability to focus light properly, which could be due to inflammation or damage to the retina.
   - Normal ocular movements and slit-lamp examination findings help rule out certain causes like cataracts or other structural abnormalities.

4. **Slit-lamp examination**:
   - The presence of leukocytes in the anterior chambers of both eyes suggests an inflammatory process, which could be due to various causes including autoimmune reactions, infections, or post-traumatic inflammation.

Considering these points:

- **Option A (Reactivation of herpes zoster virus)**: While possible, reactivation would more likely present with a rash and other systemic symptoms rather than isolated eye symptoms.
  
- **Option B (Autoimmune reaction against retinal antigens)**: This is the most plausible explanation. Post-traumatic glaucoma can lead to an autoimmune response that causes inflammation in the anterior chamber, leading to leukocytes and decreased vision.

- **Option C (Impaired drainage of aqueous humor)**: While impaired drainage could contribute to increased IOP, it would not directly explain the patient's symptoms of blurry vision and difficulty opening his eyes in bright surroundings without other signs of glaucoma.

- **Option D (Age-related denaturation of lens proteins)**: This is more relevant to cataracts rather than acute inflammatory or infectious processes affecting the eye.

Therefore, considering the patient's history, physical examination findings, and slit-lamp examination results, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is an autoimmune reaction against retinal antigens, which could be triggered by his recent trauma.
