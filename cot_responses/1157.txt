Given the findings from the mammogram, core needle biopsy, laboratory studies, and clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is to perform a bone scan.

The key points that led us to this conclusion are:

1. The mammogram shows a 6.5mm sized mass with an irregular border and spiculated margins, which suggests a malignant process.
2. The core needle biopsy confirms infiltrating ductal carcinoma with HER2-positive, estrogen-negative, and progesterone-negative immunohistochemistry staining, indicating that the cancer is aggressive and likely to be widespread.
3. Laboratory studies show normal blood counts and liver function tests, but elevated alkaline phosphatase (25 U/L) and ALT (15 U/L), which may indicate bone metastasis or other systemic effects of the cancer.

A bone scan is a crucial diagnostic tool in this scenario because it can help identify any skeletal metastases that may be causing the patient's symptoms. This is particularly important given the patient's age, as osteolytic lesions are more common in older adults. A bone scan can also help guide further management decisions, such as whether to proceed with surgery or other treatments.

In contrast, the other options are not as directly relevant:

* Breast-conserving therapy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (A) may be considered for patients with early-stage breast cancer, but this patient's biopsy results indicate aggressive disease.
* Bilateral mastectomy with lymph node dissection (C) is a more extensive surgical approach that may be necessary for some patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the current findings.
* Whole-body PET/CT (B) can help identify metastatic disease, but it is typically used after bone scan results are available to guide further management decisions.

Therefore, a bone scan is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient.
