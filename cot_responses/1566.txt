Given the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and progressively worsening respiratory symptoms over 6 months, along with his physical examination findings of expiratory wheezing bilaterally on spirometry, we can deduce that he likely suffers from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The presence of an FEV1 of 73% of predicted and improvement with albuterol suggests a mild to moderate COPD.

The management of COPD typically involves a combination of bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and long-term control of symptoms. Considering the patient's age (28 years) and lack of significant smoking history or other risk factors for COPD, we should prioritize a medication that is effective in controlling symptoms without exacerbating the disease.

Option A (A long-acting beta-agonist alone) may not be sufficient as a standalone treatment due to the patient's mild to moderate COPD. Long-acting beta-agonists are more commonly used in patients with severe COPD or those who require more frequent use of short-acting beta-agonists.

Option B (A low-dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist) is the most appropriate therapy for this patient. Inhaled corticosteroids are recommended as first-line treatment for mild to moderate COPD due to their ability to reduce inflammation and slow disease progression. A low dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be sufficient given the patient's age and lack of significant smoking history, while a long-acting beta-agonist can help control symptoms.

Option C (A medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist) is also a reasonable option but might not provide enough symptom control for someone with mild to moderate COPD. A higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids may be necessary, but the addition of a long-acting beta-agonist could exacerbate symptoms.

Option D (A high-dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist) is not typically recommended for patients with mild to moderate COPD due to the potential for increased side effects and reduced efficacy compared to lower doses.

Therefore, considering the patient's age, lack of significant smoking history, and mild to moderate COPD, the most appropriate therapy would be a low-dose inhaled cort
