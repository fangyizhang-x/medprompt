## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient presents with a 2-month history of increasing generalized fatigue and severe pruritus, which are symptoms commonly associated with liver disease. The physical examination findings of scleral icterus (jaundice) and multiple scratch marks on the trunk and extremities suggest chronic liver disease or cirrhosis.

Laboratory studies show anemia (low hemoglobin), elevated leukocyte count, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT). The presence of bilirubin elevation with a low direct bilirubin ratio suggests cholestasis, which is the reduction or stoppage of bile flow. The abdominal ultrasound findings of thickening of the bile ducts and focal bile duct dilatation are highly suggestive of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a chronic liver disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the bile ducts.

The negative results for anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) help to rule out autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis, respectively. IgG4-associated cholangitis is a rare condition that typically presents with elevated alkaline phosphatase levels and can cause bile duct dilation, but it does not typically present with the same level of anemia or pruritus as seen in PSC.

Therefore, based on the combination of clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is primary sclerosing cholangitis (B).
