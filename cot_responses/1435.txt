## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), also known as Wegener's granulomatosis, we can expect to see certain laboratory findings due to the involvement of the kidneys in this condition. GPA is characterized by vasculitis affecting small- and medium-sized vessels, which can lead to kidney damage.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with GPA, including renal involvement (indicated by high blood pressure and signs of renal impairment as evidenced by the low oxygen saturation on room air).

In GPA, the kidneys are typically affected early in the disease course, leading to acute kidney injury or nephritis. This condition is often associated with hypokalemia due to the loss of potassium ions through the damaged renal tubules.

Regarding metabolic acidosis, GPA can lead to a mixed acid-base disorder due to the involvement of the respiratory and renal systems. However, in this case, we are more likely to see metabolic alkalosis rather than acidosis, as the kidneys may retain bicarbonate or excrete it inappropriately due to the tubulointerstitial damage.

Therefore, considering the expected findings in GPA, the most likely serum laboratory study finding would be hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.
