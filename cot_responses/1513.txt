Given the patient's presentation, which includes sudden onset of leg pain and swelling in a previously asymptomatic limb, along with signs of inflammation such as redness, warmth, and tenderness, the most likely diagnosis is deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The physical examination findings also support this diagnosis.

The Wells' clinical probability tool (A) is a useful tool for assessing the risk of DVT in patients presenting with acute leg pain and swelling. It takes into account several factors such as age, weight, history of cancer, surgery, or trauma, and presence of risk factors like immobility, recent surgery, or malignancy.

In contrast, computerized tomography (CT) with contrast (B) is typically used to evaluate the lungs, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, adrenal glands, and other organs for abnormalities. While it may be useful in certain cases of suspected DVT, such as when there are signs of pulmonary embolism or when CT scans are contraindicated due to radiation exposure, it is not the best initial step in managing this patient's condition.

The International normalized ratio (INR) (C) is a measure of blood clotting that is used to assess the risk of bleeding and thrombosis. While it may be relevant in certain cases of DVT, such as when there are signs of bleeding or when anticoagulation therapy needs to be adjusted, it is not the best initial step in managing this patient's condition.

Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (D) is a test that measures the time it takes for blood to clot. While it may be used to evaluate the function of the coagulation cascade and monitor anticoagulant therapy, it is not typically used as an initial step in managing DVT.

Therefore, the best initial step in the management of this patient's condition would be to use the Wells' clinical probability tool (A) to assess the risk of DVT.
