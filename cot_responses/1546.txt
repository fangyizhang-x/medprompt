To determine where the patient likely received the intramuscular injection, let's consider the anatomy and function of the muscles in the thigh.

The quadriceps femoris muscle is a group of four muscles that make up the anterior compartment of the thigh. It is responsible for knee extension (lifting the leg straight up) and hip flexion (bending the hip). The quadriceps femoris muscle is innervated by the femoral nerve, which originates from the lumbar plexus.

The patient's limp suggests weakness or paralysis of the muscles in the lower extremity. Given that he was hospitalized for acute cholecystitis and underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, it is likely that the surgery involved the left hip. The quadriceps femoris muscle is innervated by the femoral nerve, which arises from the lumbar plexus.

The femoral nerve is located in the anterior (front) aspect of the thigh, and its course can be described as follows:

- It originates from the lumbar plexus, specifically L2-L4.
- It passes through the inguinal ligament to enter the thigh.
- It then courses downward along the medial aspect of the thigh, passing between the adductor magnus and adductor longus muscles.

Given that the patient's limp is worse when he raises his left foot to take a step, it suggests weakness or paralysis of the quadriceps femoris muscle on the left side. This would be consistent with an injury to the femoral nerve on the left side.

Therefore, considering the anatomy and function of the muscles in the thigh, the patient likely received the intramuscular injection into the anteromedial quadrant (A) of the buttock, which is where the femoral nerve originates from. This location would be consistent with an injury to the femoral nerve on the left side.

The other options are less likely:

- B and C refer to quadrilateral regions in the buttock that are not directly related to the femoral nerve.
- D refers to a region of the buttock that is more lateral (toward the back) than where the femoral nerve originates from.
