## Step 1: Analyze the situation
The patient, a 31-year-old comedian, is presenting with depressive symptoms and is undergoing psychodynamic psychotherapy for these issues. He has identified ways to channel his emotions about his abusive childhood into comedy routines, which suggests that he may be using humor as an escape or defense mechanism.

## Step 2: Identify the immature defense mechanisms
Denial (A) involves refusing to acknowledge reality or a problem that exists. Reaction formation (B) is when someone expresses the opposite of their true feelings or attitudes in order to avoid dealing with uncomfortable emotions. Splitting (C) is when an individual attributes negative qualities to one person and positive qualities to another. Suppression (D) involves pushing unpleasant thoughts, memories, or desires into the unconscious mind.

## Step 3: Consider the context of the patient's behavior
The patient avoids eye contact and tells you he "doesn't want to talk about it anymore," which suggests that he is not willing to engage in a discussion about his childhood. This avoidance can be seen as an attempt to avoid dealing with uncomfortable emotions or memories.

## Step 4: Match the patient's behavior with the immature defense mechanisms
Given the context and the patient's behavior, reaction formation (B) seems like the most likely immature defense mechanism exhibited by this patient. Reaction formation involves expressing the opposite of one's true feelings in order to avoid dealing with uncomfortable emotions or memories.

The final answer is: B
