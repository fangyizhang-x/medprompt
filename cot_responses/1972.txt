## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's analyze each option to identify which pair is correctly matched.

A. Diphtheria toxin - cleaves synaptobrevin, blocking vesicle formation and the release of acetylcholine: This statement is partially correct in that diphtheria toxin does indeed cleave synaptobrevin, but it also has a mechanism of action that involves inhibiting protein synthesis by ADP-ribosylating elongation factor-2 (EF-2). However, this option doesn't mention the role of acetylcholine release.

B. Cholera toxin - ADP-ribosylates Gs, keeping adenylate cyclase active and â†‘ [cAMP]: This statement is incorrect because cholera toxin actually ADP-ribosylates and activates guanylate cyclase, leading to an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, not cAMP.

C. Botulinum toxin - cleaves synaptobrevin, blocking vesicle formation and the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and glycine: This statement is correct as botulinum toxin does indeed cleave synaptobrevin, which blocks vesicle formation and releases inhibitory neurotransmitters such as GABA and glycine.

D. Anthrax toxin - ADP-ribosylates elongation factor - 2 (EF-2) and inhibits protein synthesis: This statement is incorrect because anthrax toxin actually ADP-ribosylates elongation factor-3 (EF-3), not EF-2, and inhibits protein synthesis by blocking the translation process.

Therefore, the correct pair of exotoxins matched from the options given is C. Botulinum toxin - cleaves synaptobrevin, blocking vesicle formation and the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and glycine.
