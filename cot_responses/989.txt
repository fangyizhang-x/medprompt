## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of sudden onset right lower abdominal pain, vomiting, guarding, and pelvic exam findings (blood pooling in the vagina and right adnexal tenderness), along with a positive pregnancy test, the most likely diagnosis is an ectopic pregnancy. The presence of blood pooling in the vagina and right adnexal tenderness are particularly suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy.

The appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to confirm the diagnosis through imaging. Among the options provided:

A. Transabdominal ultrasound: This is a non-invasive, first-line imaging modality for evaluating abdominal pain and pelvic exam findings. It can help identify the location of the pregnancy, assess for any other intra-abdominal pathology, and rule out ectopic pregnancy.

B. Dilation and curettage (D&C): While D&C may be considered in some cases of ectopic pregnancy, it is not typically the first step due to the potential risks associated with the procedure, especially if the patient has a history of pelvic surgery or other underlying medical conditions.

C. Transvaginal ultrasound: This modality provides higher resolution images than transabdominal ultrasound and can more accurately assess for an ectopic pregnancy, particularly in the presence of adnexal tenderness. However, it may not be as sensitive as transabdominal ultrasound for detecting small ectopic pregnancies.

D. Methotrexate and discharge with strict follow-up instructions: This approach is inappropriate given the patient's presentation and positive pregnancy test. Methotrexate is a medication used to treat ectopic pregnancy, but it should only be considered after imaging confirmation of the diagnosis and in cases where there are contraindications or specific indications for its use.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis is to perform a transabdominal ultrasound to confirm the presence of an ectopic pregnancy.
