## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The correct answer can be deduced by understanding the characteristics of each phase of a clinical trial.

- **Phase I**: This is the first stage of testing in human subjects, where a new drug or treatment is administered to a small group of people (usually 20-80) to assess its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Since SD27C has been tested on 500 patients and showed similar outcomes in both groups, it falls under this phase.

- **Phase II**: This stage involves larger groups (100-300 participants) to further evaluate the efficacy, side effects, and optimal dosage of a new drug or treatment. Given that the results are already comparable between the two groups, Phase II is not applicable here.

- **Phase III**: Conducted on a much larger group (500-3,000 participants), this phase aims to confirm the efficacy and safety of a new drug or treatment in various populations, including different age groups, ethnicities, and other factors. Since SD27C's results are already comparable between the two groups, Phase III is not applicable.

- **Phase IV**: This stage involves post-marketing surveillance, where a new drug or treatment is monitored for any side effects, adverse reactions, or long-term efficacy after it has been approved for general use. While this might be an ongoing aspect of SD27C's development, the fact that the results are already comparable between the two groups suggests that Phase IV might not be the correct answer.

- **Post-market surveillance**: This is a broader term that encompasses any monitoring or follow-up activities conducted after a drug has been approved for general use. While this could include Phase IV, it's too broad and doesn't specifically indicate the phase of investigation.

Therefore, considering the information provided, SD27C is currently under investigation in **Phase III** because its results are already comparable between the two groups, indicating that further testing is not needed to confirm efficacy or safety.
