## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The increase in the host range of HIV can be attributed to a mutation in the gene coding for viral surface glycoproteins, specifically the gp120 subunit.

1. **Understanding the role of gp120**: The gp120 subunit is responsible for binding to CD4 receptors on T cells and facilitating the entry of the virus into these cells.
2. **Consequence of gp120 mutation**: A mutation in the gp120 gene could alter its binding specificity, allowing it to bind not only to CD4 but also to other cell surface proteins or molecules that are normally targeted by HIV.
3. **Mechanism of action**: This would enable HIV to infect fibroblast-like cells, which are not typically infected by the standard HIV strain, thereby increasing its host range.
4. **Comparison with other options**:
   - Point mutations in the hemagglutinin gene (option B) could affect the virus's ability to bind to CD4 receptors but would likely not increase the host range of HIV.
   - Reassortment of genetic material between segments of two viruses (option C) is a process that occurs during viral evolution and can lead to new strains with altered properties, including increased host range. However, this is more related to the emergence of new strains rather than an intrinsic property of the virus itself.
   - Excessive activity of viral RNA polymerase (option D) would likely affect the replication rate or efficiency but not directly influence the host range.

Therefore, the most direct explanation for the increase in the host range of HIV is a mutation in the gp120 gene that alters its binding specificity.
