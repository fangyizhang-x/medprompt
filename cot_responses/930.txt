Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is preeclampsia, a condition characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys. The patient's symptoms, such as abdominal pain, decreased fetal movement, and restlessness with sweating, are classic for preeclampsia.

The key laboratory findings that support this diagnosis include:

- Elevated blood pressure (90/60 mm Hg) and low platelet count (1.1*10^5/ml), which can be seen in preeclampsia.
- Normal hemoglobin level, but a slightly decreased hematocrit, which may not be as significant given the patient's overall anemia is mild.

The presence of no fetal heart motion or movement on the ultrasound further supports this diagnosis. The low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is often used in the management of preeclampsia to prevent thromboembolic events, which can occur due to the coagulopathy associated with this condition.

Considering the patient's gestational age and symptoms, the immediate course of management would be to initiate anticoagulation therapy to reduce the risk of thrombosis. The choice of LMWH is appropriate for this scenario as it is effective in preventing thromboembolic events without affecting coagulation studies significantly.

The other options are not immediately necessary:

- IV fluids (A) may be beneficial to manage the patient's hypotension and fluid overload, but they do not address the underlying cause of preeclampsia.
- D-dimer assay (B) is a test used to diagnose deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, which are less likely in this scenario given the patient's presentation and laboratory findings.
- Fresh frozen plasma (C) may be considered if there were evidence of coagulopathy or bleeding, but it is not necessary for initial management of preeclampsia.

Therefore, the best immediate course of management for this patient is to initiate anticoagulation therapy with LMWH.
