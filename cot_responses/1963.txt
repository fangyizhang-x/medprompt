## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key elements and analyze them step by step:

1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient presents with severe dyspnea (difficulty breathing) and is unresponsive upon arrival. These symptoms suggest acute respiratory distress or failure.

2. **Vital Signs**: The patient has tachycardia (elevated heart rate), tachypnea (rapid respirations), and hypotension (low blood pressure). These signs indicate shock, which can be due to various causes including cardiac, respiratory, or vascular issues.

3. **Diagnostic Findings**: CT angiography of the chest reveals extensive pulmonary embolism in both lungs. Pulmonary embolism is a known cause of acute respiratory distress and shock.

4. **Treatment Goal**: The goal is to inhibit thrombin (a key enzyme in blood clot formation) and factor Xa, which are crucial for clot formation. This suggests we're looking for an anticoagulant that targets these pathways.

5. **Medication Options**:
   - A. Ticagrelor: An antiplatelet medication used primarily to prevent platelet aggregation in conditions like acute coronary syndrome.
   - B. Apixaban: An oral direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that inhibits factor Xa, making it a strong candidate for the described scenario.
   - C. Unfractioned heparin: An anticoagulant that works by activating antithrombin III and inhibiting thrombin and factor Xa. However, its use is typically more complex due to its need for frequent dosing and monitoring of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).
   - D. Fondaparinux: A synthetic pentasaccharide that inhibits factor Xa without activating antithrombin III. It's often used in patients with atrial fibrillation or deep vein thrombosis.

Given the patient's presentation of acute respiratory distress and pulmonary embolism, the most likely medication administered would be one that directly addresses both clot formation (through inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa) and has a rapid onset of action to counteract shock. Fondaparinux is known for its efficacy in anticoagulation therapy with a more straightforward dosing regimen compared to unfractionated heparin, making it an attractive option.

Therefore, the answer is D.
