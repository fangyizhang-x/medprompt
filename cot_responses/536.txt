(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's symptoms, including worsening pain and swelling in her left knee, difficulty moving around for an hour, sweating more than usual, especially at night, and recent alcohol consumption (6 beers the day before), suggest a possible diagnosis of septic arthritis. The presence of greenish, turbid synovial fluid with a high cell count and Gram-negative diplococci on arthrocentesis is highly suggestive of gonococcal infection.

The patient's history of new sexual activity with an untested partner in the past 4 weeks increases her risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including gonorrhea. The fact that she has been drinking alcohol and has a fever also supports this diagnosis.

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely x-ray finding is related to the joint infection caused by gonococcus. 

- Option A: Calcifications and osteolysis with moth-eaten appearance are more typical of degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.
- Option B: Irregularity or fragmentation of the tubercle is characteristic of tuberculosis, which is less likely given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of a bacterial infection.
- Option C: Calcification of the meniscal and hyaline cartilage could be seen in conditions such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, but it does not explain the presence of Gram-negative diplococci in the synovial fluid.
- Option D: Joint space narrowing and bone erosions are typical findings in septic arthritis caused by various pathogens, including gonococcus. These changes occur due to the inflammatory response and destruction of joint tissue.

Therefore, the most likely x-ray finding is joint space narrowing and bone erosions, which would be consistent with a diagnosis of septic arthritis caused by gonococcus.

The patient should be treated promptly with antibiotics (likely ceftriaxone and azithromycin) to eradicate the infection. The knee should be immobilized in a splint or cast to reduce pain and swelling, and the patient's symptoms should be monitored closely for signs of improvement or worsening.
