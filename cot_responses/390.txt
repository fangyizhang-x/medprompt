Given the clinical presentation of an 18-month-old boy with a rash around the eyes and mouth, which started 2 weeks ago and is itchy due to scratching, we need to consider several factors that could contribute to this condition.

Firstly, the patient's age and the fact that he has a history of asthma make certain diagnoses less likely. For instance, impetigo (B) typically presents as a localized skin infection, which doesn't fully explain the widespread nature of the rash in this case. Atopic dermatitis (C), also known as eczema, can cause itchy rashes but is not typically associated with the presence of oral lesions or the specific location around the eyes and mouth.

The patient's recent diagnosis of asthma (D) could be relevant because atopic dermatitis often co-exists with asthma. However, this doesn't directly explain the rash in the oral area.

Viral conjunctivitis (A), commonly known as pink eye, is a highly contagious infection that can cause itchy, watery eyes and sometimes a rash around the eyes. It's more common in young children who are not yet fully vaccinated against certain viruses. The presence of bilateral expiratory wheezes bilaterally on examination could suggest an underlying respiratory issue, which might be contributing to the overall clinical picture.

Considering these factors, viral conjunctivitis seems like a plausible diagnosis for this patient. It's a common condition in young children that can cause itchy eyes and a rash around the eyes, especially if there are associated respiratory symptoms.

The final answer is: A
