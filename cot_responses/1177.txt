Given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the most appropriate next test for this 23-year-old man is to investigate the sacroiliac (SI) joints.

The patient reports lower back pain that worsens in the morning and improves with physical activity. This pattern of pain exacerbation with activity is characteristic of inflammatory back pain, which is often associated with conditions affecting the SI joints, such as ankylosing spondylitis or psoriatic arthritis.

The decreased spinal range of motion and absence of saddle anesthesia on physical exam also support this diagnosis. Saddle anesthesia is a sign typically seen in patients with sacroiliac joint inflammation, where the nerves that supply the buttocks are irritated.

Radiographs (X-rays) of the sacroiliac joints would provide more information about any structural changes or abnormalities in the SI joints, such as osteophytes, bone spurs, or joint effusions. However, given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, an MRI of the sacroiliac joint is likely to be more sensitive for detecting inflammatory changes and soft tissue involvement.

ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) is a blood test that measures inflammation in the body, but it would not provide specific information about the SI joints or the patient's condition. A slit-lamp examination is typically used to diagnose eye conditions, such as conjunctivitis or uveitis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform an MRI of the sacroiliac joint to evaluate for inflammation and soft tissue involvement, which would help guide further management and treatment decisions.
