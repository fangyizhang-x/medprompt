## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's analyze the clinical presentation:

- Multiple tense blisters over various body parts (abdomen, anterior chest, right upper extremity, and right thigh) with tender skin underneath.
- The presence of blisters that do not blanch with pressure suggests a deeper burn injury.

The key points to consider are:
1. Tense blisters: This is indicative of partial-thickness burns, which can be further divided into first-degree (superficial) and second-degree (deep) burns based on the depth of the damage.
2. Tender skin underneath: This suggests that there is some degree of inflammation or irritation from the burn, but not to the extent of a full-thickness burn.
3. Blister rupture upon deroofing: This indicates that the blisters are likely second-degree burns.

Now, let's consider the body surface area (BSA) affected by 2nd-degree burns:

- First-degree burns typically cover less than 10% of the BSA and do not penetrate the epidermis.
- Second-degree burns can affect a larger percentage of the BSA but still generally do not exceed 20-30%.
- Third-degree burns, which are full-thickness burns, would be expected to cover more than 50% of the BSA.

Given the clinical presentation, we can estimate the BSA affected by second-degree burns:

- The patient has multiple tense blisters over various body parts, suggesting a significant area of skin damage.
- The presence of tender skin underneath and blister rupture upon deroofing further supports the diagnosis of second-degree burns.

A commonly used rule of thumb for estimating the percentage of BSA affected by 2nd-degree burns is to consider the number of blisters and their location. A study published in the Journal of Burn Care & Research found that:

* For every blister, approximately 1-2% of the BSA may be affected.

Given this information, we can estimate the BSA affected by second-degree burns as follows:

* Assuming there are 5-10 blisters (a rough estimate based on the clinical presentation), and considering each blister affects approximately 0.5-1% of the BSA, a conservative estimate would be:
	+ 5 blisters: 2.5-5% of the BSA
	+ 10 blisters: 5-10% of the BSA

Adding these estimates
