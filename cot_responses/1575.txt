## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Agitation and screaming for help**: This suggests a possible seizure or status epilepticus.
2. **Dizziness and tingling in the lips and hands**: These symptoms are indicative of neurological involvement, possibly indicating a seizure or encephalopathy.
3. **Past medical history of general anxiety disorder managed medically with paroxetine**: While this is relevant for understanding potential medication side effects, it does not directly relate to the current presentation.

Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is a seizure, specifically a status epilepticus, which can be caused by various factors including cardiac arrhythmias, metabolic disorders, or other medical conditions. The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with this diagnosis.

Now, let's consider the arterial blood gas (ABG) results:

- **pH**: A decreased pH indicates acidosis.
- **HCO3- (Bicarbonate)**: Decreased bicarbonate levels can be seen in metabolic acidosis or respiratory failure.
- **Pco2 (Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide)**: Decreased Pco2 is consistent with a respiratory alkalosis, which can occur due to hyperventilation.

Considering the likely diagnosis of status epilepticus and its potential causes:

- **Cardiac arrhythmias** could lead to acidosis due to impaired ventilation and increased CO2 production.
- **Metabolic disorders**, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis, could also cause metabolic acidosis.
- **Respiratory failure** can lead to respiratory alkalosis.

Given these considerations:

The expected ABG results for a patient with status epilepticus would be decreased pH (indicating acidosis), decreased HCO3- (indicating metabolic acidosis or respiratory failure), and decreased Pco2 (indicating respiratory alkalosis).

Therefore, the answer is:
