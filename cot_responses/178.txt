## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The cardiologist is explaining that the resting membrane potential of cardiac myocytes is close to the equilibrium potential of K+ ions, which suggests that there is a significant inward flow of K+ ions into the cell. This is due to the high resting potassium conductance of ventricular myocytes, which is regulated by specific potassium channels.

The cardiologist mentions that these potassium channels are open at rest and are closed when there is depolarization. Based on this information, we can infer that the cardiologist is talking about inward rectifier potassium channels (IKACh).

Inward rectifier potassium channels are a type of potassium channel that allows K+ ions to flow into the cell during depolarization, which helps to reduce the resting membrane potential and facilitate repolarization. The IKACh subtype is one of these channels, which is known for its high conductance and sensitivity to hyperkalemia.

The other options are not correct because:

* A. Inward rectifier IK1 potassium channels are involved in the regulation of the action potential duration, but they do not play a significant role in the resting membrane potential.
* C. Fast delayed rectifier IKr potassium channels are involved in the repolarization phase of the action potential and have a high conductance, but they do not contribute to the resting membrane potential.
* D. Transient outward current Ito potassium channels are involved in the rapid depolarization phase of the action potential and have a low conductance, which is not consistent with the cardiologist's description.

Therefore, based on the information provided by the cardiologist, the correct answer is B. Inward rectifier IKACh potassium channels.
