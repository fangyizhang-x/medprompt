## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's analyze the study design:

- The researcher enrolls 100 patients and randomly assigns them to two groups.
- Both syringes are unlabeled, making it impossible to determine which substance was used in each group without further testing.

Given this design, we can conclude that the study is a **randomized controlled trial (RCT)**. RCTs are considered the gold standard for determining the effectiveness of a treatment or intervention because they minimize bias and ensure that any differences between groups are due to the intervention itself rather than other factors.

In an RCT like this one, the level of evidence provided by the study would be **Level 1**, which is known as a "systematic review of clinical trials." This type of study provides high-quality evidence because it involves a systematic and rigorous process for identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing all relevant studies on a particular intervention.

Therefore, the answer is A.
