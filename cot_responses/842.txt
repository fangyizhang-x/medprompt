Given the clinical presentation of this 22-year-old woman, we can analyze each option to determine which one provides the strongest indication for administering intravenous antibiotics.

Firstly, let's consider the patient's symptoms:

- Double vision and rapidly worsening pain and swelling in her right eye suggest an orbital or periorbital infection.
- The presence of proptosis (bulging of the eye), diffuse edema, erythema, and tenderness of the eyelids indicates a severe inflammatory process.
- Painful movements and restricted eye movements further support the diagnosis of an orbital or periorbital infection.

Now, let's evaluate each option in relation to the patient's condition:

A. Worsening of ocular pain - While worsening pain is a symptom of the patient's condition, it does not specifically indicate the need for intravenous antibiotics.

B. Leukocytosis - An elevated leukocyte count (12,000/mm3) suggests an infectious process, but it is not specific to bacterial infections and can be seen in various conditions, including viral or autoimmune causes.

C. Pain with eye movements - This symptom is highly suggestive of an orbital or periorbital infection, as the pain associated with movement is a characteristic feature of these conditions.

D. Purulent nasal discharge and right cheek tenderness - While purulent nasal discharge is a symptom of a respiratory tract infection, which this patient had recently, it does not directly relate to her current symptoms in the eye.

Considering the above analysis, the strongest indication for administering intravenous antibiotics to this patient is pain with eye movements (C), as it is a specific and characteristic symptom of an orbital or periorbital infection.
