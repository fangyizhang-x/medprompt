## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To solve this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the medication**: The patient was started on a medication that irreversibly inhibits the synthesis of thromboxane A2 and prostaglandins. This description matches aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), which is known to inhibit the synthesis of these substances.

2. **Understand the mechanism of action**: Aspirin works by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 enzymes, which are crucial for the production of thromboxane A2 and prostaglandins. This inhibition leads to a decrease in platelet aggregation and inflammation.

3. **Identify potential adverse effects**: Given aspirin's mechanism of action, we can consider its known side effects:
   - Chronic rhinosinusitis (A) is not typically associated with aspirin use.
   - Acute interstitial nephritis (B) is a rare but serious side effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin. It involves inflammation of the renal tubules and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
   - Tinnitus (C) is more commonly associated with certain medications, such as antibiotics or antihistamines, rather than NSAIDs like aspirin.
   - Gastrointestinal hemorrhage (D) is a known risk of long-term aspirin use but is less likely to be the most immediate concern in this scenario.

4. **Select the most likely adverse effect**: Based on the mechanism of action and known side effects of aspirin, acute interstitial nephritis (B) stands out as the most plausible answer.

The final answer is: B
