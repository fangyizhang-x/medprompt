Given the clinical presentation of this 7-month-old boy, we can deduce that he is experiencing episodes of abdominal pain and vomiting, which are accompanied by periods of increased frequency and intensity. These symptoms are suggestive of a condition known as functional abdominal pain or functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID). The presence of blood in his diaper further supports the diagnosis.

The key to managing this condition lies in identifying the underlying cause of the functional abdominal pain. Given the age of the patient, it is essential to consider conditions that may affect infants and young children, such as constipation, pyloric stenosis, or other functional gastrointestinal disorders.

A supportive care approach (Option A) would be inappropriate as it does not address the underlying cause of the symptoms. An abdominal CT scan (Option C) might be useful in some cases but is not typically the first step in management for a condition like FGID. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Option D) are unlikely to be beneficial in this scenario.

The most appropriate next step would be to perform an air contrast enema (Option B). This procedure involves introducing air into the colon through the rectum, which can help identify any structural abnormalities or obstructions that may be contributing to the functional abdominal pain. Additionally, it can provide valuable information about the patency of the gastrointestinal tract and the presence of any inflammatory changes.

Therefore, after confirming the diagnosis with an abdominal ultrasound (which would likely show a normal appearance), the next step in management is to perform an air contrast enema to help identify any underlying causes of functional abdominal pain.
