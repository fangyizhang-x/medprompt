## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, including bilateral arm numbness, superficial skin ulcerations on his fingers, loss of light touch and pinprick response in specific areas, and intact vibratory sense, we can deduce that the affected structures are likely involved in the transmission of sensory information from the upper limb to the brain.

The presence of superficial skin ulcerations suggests a possible neuropathy affecting the dermal-nerve connections. The loss of light touch and pinprick response specifically implicates the spinothalamic tract, which is responsible for transmitting these types of sensations.

Considering the patient's history of psoriatic arthritis, we should also consider the possibility of peripheral neuropathy due to chronic inflammation or damage to the nerves. However, in this case, the specific pattern of sensory loss (light touch and pinprick) points more towards a central nervous system (CNS) lesion rather than a peripheral one.

The anterior corticospinal tract is primarily involved in motor function, which does not match the patient's symptoms. The cuneate fasciculus is also involved in motor function, but it is more associated with the coordination of movements between different parts of the body. The spinocerebellar tracts are responsible for transmitting sensory information from the body to the cerebellum and are not directly implicated in the loss of light touch and pinprick response.

The ventral white commissure (A) is a structure involved in the transmission of visual information, which does not match the patient's symptoms. Therefore, we can conclude that the most likely affected nervous system structure is the spinothalamic tract, which is responsible for transmitting sensory information from the upper limb to the brain.

The answer choice that best matches this conclusion is C. Anterior corticospinal tract.
