Given that the patient has Graves' disease, a condition characterized by hyperthyroidism, and her symptoms have not improved with medication, it is likely that the exophthalmos (bulging eyes) is related to the underlying thyroid hormone imbalance. The correct answer can be deduced by considering the typical treatment options for Graves' disease.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option:

A. Propanolol - This is a beta-blocker used to treat hypertension and certain heart conditions. It is not typically used to treat hyperthyroidism or exophthalmos associated with Graves' disease.

B. Metoprolol - Similar to propranolol, metoprolol is also a beta-blocker that can be used to manage hypertension and certain cardiac conditions. It is not the first-line treatment for Graves' disease.

C. PTU (Propylthiouracil) - This is an antithyroid medication commonly used to treat hyperthyroidism by inhibiting thyroid hormone synthesis. Given that the patient's symptoms have not improved with medication, PTU would be a suitable next step in her treatment plan.

D. Corticosteroids - While corticosteroids can be used in certain cases of Graves' disease, they are typically reserved for more severe or resistant cases and are not the first-line treatment for mild to moderate hyperthyroidism.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms and the typical treatment options for Graves' disease, the physician should have prescribed PTU to treat her exophthalmos.
