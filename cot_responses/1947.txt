To answer this question, let's consider the effects of fluid resuscitation on the patient with acute pancreatitis.

1. **Understanding Acute Pancreatitis**: Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas that can cause severe abdominal pain and vomiting. It often leads to hypovolemia (decreased blood volume) due to third spacing of fluids, which can worsen the condition.

2. **Fluid Resuscitation Goals**: The primary goal of fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis is to restore circulating volume, maintain perfusion of vital organs, and prevent further complications such as organ failure.

3. **Effects on Cardiac Afterload (A)**: Fluid resuscitation increases venous return to the heart, which can increase cardiac afterload. This means that the pressure against which the heart must pump blood is increased, potentially leading to hypertension. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

4. **Effect on Volume of Distribution (B)**: The volume of distribution refers to the amount of a drug or fluid distributed into the body tissues and organs. Fluid resuscitation aims to increase circulating volume, not the volume of distribution. This means that option B is also incorrect.

5. **Increase in Myocardial Oxygen Demand (C)**: While fluid resuscitation can lead to increased cardiac output, which may initially increase myocardial oxygen demand due to increased blood flow and metabolic activity, this effect is typically short-lived as the patient's condition improves with resolution of hypovolemia and inflammation.

6. **Increase in Glomerular Filtration Fraction (D)**: Fluid resuscitation increases venous return to the heart, which can increase cardiac preload. This increase in preload leads to an increase in the glomerular filtration fraction (GFR), as more blood is available for filtration through the kidneys. Therefore, option D is correct.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
