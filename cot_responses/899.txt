## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's consider what we know about beta thalassemia and the types of mutations that can affect protein function.

Beta thalassemia is a genetic disorder characterized by reduced or absent production of the beta-globin chains of hemoglobin. This results in anemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis (red blood cell production). The malformed protein found in the boy's red blood cells suggests that there has been a mutation affecting the structure or function of the beta-globin chain.

Let's consider each option:

A. Frameshift mutation: A frameshift mutation occurs when an insertion or deletion of nucleotides changes the reading frame of the genetic code, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence. This type of mutation is unlikely to result in a protein with 160 amino acids, as it would likely introduce stop codons or premature termination signals.

B. Missense mutation: A missense mutation involves a change in one amino acid residue in a protein due to a point mutation in the DNA sequence. While this can lead to changes in protein function, it typically results in a single amino acid substitution rather than a significant increase in size (160 amino acids).

C. Nonsense mutation: A nonsense mutation is a type of point mutation that introduces a premature stop codon into the genetic code, leading to a truncated and often non-functional protein. This would result in a shorter protein with fewer amino acids.

D. Splice site mutation: A splice site mutation involves a change at one of the introns (non-coding regions) or exons (coding regions) that affects the splicing process, leading to aberrant mRNA processing and potentially resulting in an abnormal protein. This type of mutation can lead to significant changes in protein size.

Given the information provided, the most likely explanation for the malformed protein with a length of 160 amino acids is a splice site mutation. This would disrupt normal mRNA splicing, leading to aberrant protein production that results in the observed 160-amino acid protein.

Therefore, the answer is D.
