## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's consider the key points from the patient's history and physical exam findings:

1. **Patient's History**: The patient is a 53-year-old farmer with a pigmented lesion on his arm that has been slowly growing in size for the past year. This suggests a chronic process rather than an acute one.

2. **Physical Exam Findings**:
   - A: Different pigmentation throughout the lesion could indicate a variety of conditions, including melanoma or other benign lesions.
   - B: Hyperpigmented lesion with smooth borders is more suggestive of a melanoma, as it often presents as a well-circumscribed, non-overlapping lesion. However, this option does not rule out other possibilities like melanoma.
   - C: Symmetrical ovoid lesion could be indicative of several conditions, including melanoma or basal cell carcinoma (BCC), but the symmetry and lack of mention of any other characteristics make it less likely to be malignant without further context.
   - D: Tenderness to palpation is a concerning finding that suggests a possible malignancy. Benign lesions are typically not tender upon palpation, whereas malignant lesions can be.

Given these considerations:

- The patient's age and occupation as a farmer increase the likelihood of skin cancer, particularly melanoma or BCC.
- The chronic nature of the lesion and its slow growth also supports a malignant diagnosis.
- While hyperpigmented lesions with smooth borders (B) could suggest melanoma, this option does not account for the tenderness to palpation (D), which is more indicative of malignancy.

Therefore, the most concerning physical exam finding that suggests a malignant diagnosis in this context would be **tenderness to palpation**. This makes option D the correct answer.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
