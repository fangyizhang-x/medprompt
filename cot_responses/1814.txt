(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's symptoms, including feeding difficulties, continuous coughing since birth, cyanotic skin coloration (cyanosis), and vomiting after every feeding, are indicative of a congenital anomaly affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Given the mother's history of polyhydramnios during her last ultrasound before delivery, it is essential to consider the potential impact on fetal development.

Polyhydramnios can lead to an increased risk of esophageal atresia (EA), which is characterized by a congenital anomaly where the esophagus does not properly connect with the stomach. This condition often presents in the neonatal period, particularly during feeding, as seen in this patient. The symptoms described are consistent with EA.

The failure of neural crest cells to migrate into the myenteric plexus (option B) is a known cause of esophageal atresia. Neural crest cells play a crucial role in the development of various structures in the gastrointestinal tract, including the formation of the esophagus and its connection to the stomach.

The other options are less likely causes of this patient's symptoms:

- Obstruction due to failure of rotation of pancreatic tissue (option A) is not directly related to the symptoms described.
- Failure of recanalization of duodenum (option C) may be associated with certain congenital anomalies, but it is not a primary cause of esophageal atresia or cyanotic skin coloration in this context.
- Defective formation of the esophagus with gastric connection to the trachea (option D) is known as esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), but it typically presents later in life, not immediately after birth.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is failure of neural crest cells to migrate into the myenteric plexus, leading to esophageal atresia.
