## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's analyze the situation: a 22-year-old man presents with severe right lower abdominal pain that started in the periumbilical region and later shifted to the right lower quadrant, accompanied by tenderness, muscle guarding, and rebound tenderness over the affected area. These symptoms are classic for acute appendicitis.

The patient undergoes laparoscopic appendectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove the appendix. The histopathologic examination of the removed appendix reveals a periappendiceal fluid collection, indicating that the inflammation is likely related to the appendix.

Now, let's consider the options:

A. IL-7: Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a cytokine involved in the development and maintenance of lymphoid tissues, including B cells and T cells. While it plays a role in immune responses, it is not directly responsible for attracting marked cells to inflamed tissue.

B. IL-8: Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a chemokine that attracts neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, to sites of inflammation. Given the patient's presentation with acute appendicitis and the presence of a periappendiceal fluid collection, which suggests an inflammatory response, IL-8 is a likely candidate for attracting marked cells to the inflamed tissue.

C. CCL-11: Chemokine C-C motif ligand 11 (CCL-11) is involved in the recruitment of neutrophils and other immune cells to sites of inflammation. While it plays a role in immune responses, its specific role in acute appendicitis is less clear than that of IL-8.

D. IL-10: Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. While it may play a role in reducing inflammation, its primary function is not to attract marked cells to inflamed tissue.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the most likely substance responsible for attracting the marked cells (neutrophils) to the inflamed tissue in acute appendicitis is IL-8.
