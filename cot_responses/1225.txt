To approach this question, let's break down the key concepts and relationships between hormones and their effects on metabolism.

1. **Understanding C-peptide**: C-peptide is a byproduct of insulin production in the pancreas. It is created during the process of insulin synthesis and secretion. Since it is produced in equal amounts to insulin itself, measuring C-peptide levels can provide insight into insulin function and secretion.

2. **Fasting vs. Fed States**: The question specifies that researchers are studying hormone levels in mice under two conditions: fasting (no food intake) and fed states (with food). This distinction is crucial because it affects the metabolism of glucose and fat, which are key sources of energy for the body.

3. **Hormones and Metabolism**:
   - **Insulin**: Primarily regulates blood sugar levels by facilitating glucose uptake in cells. It also has a role in lipid metabolism, but its primary function is not directly related to C-peptide.
   - **C-peptide**: As mentioned, it is produced during insulin synthesis and secretion. Given that researchers are interested in the hormone whose blood levels track evenly with C-peptide levels, we can infer that this hormone is closely linked to insulin.

4. **Hormones Responsible for Different Metabolic Processes**:
   - **Fatty Acid Synthesis**: This process involves the creation of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA molecules. It's primarily regulated by hormones like leptin, adiponectin, and cortisol.
   - **Fatty Acid Breakdown**: This process involves the breakdown of fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, which can then be used for energy or converted into ketone bodies. Ketogenesis is a key regulatory step in this process, often stimulated during fasting when glucose levels are low.
   - **Ketogenesis**: As mentioned, it's a critical metabolic pathway that occurs when the body runs out of glucose and needs to use stored fat as an energy source. It requires specific conditions (e.g., ketone bodies) and is regulated by hormones like glucagon and cortisol.
   - **Lipolysis**: This process involves the breakdown of triglycerides in adipose tissue into fatty acids and glycerol, which can then be used for energy or stored as fat.

Given these points, researchers are most interested in a hormone whose blood levels track evenly with C-peptide levels. The
