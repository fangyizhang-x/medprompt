## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, including painless, pruritic lesions on his left forearm that progressed to blisters and ulceration, along with a headache, fever (38.1°C or 100.6°F), pronounced edema of the surrounding skin, and painless swelling of the left axillary lymph nodes, we can deduce that this patient likely has erythema nodosum (EN).

Erythema nodosum is a type of inflammatory condition characterized by the sudden appearance of painful, tender nodules under the skin, often on the shins or buttocks. However, in this case, the lesions are located on the left forearm.

The risk factors for erythema nodosum include:

- Genetic predisposition: EN can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.
- Infections: Certain bacterial infections, such as streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infections like impetigo, can trigger EN.
- Medications: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and certain antibiotics have been associated with the development of EN.

Considering these risk factors, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. Pool swimming - While exposure to chemicals or irritants in pool water might contribute to skin conditions, it is not a well-established risk factor for erythema nodosum.
B. Wool handling - This option is highly relevant because wool can cause contact dermatitis, which shares some similarities with EN. People who work with wool or have sensitive skin may be at increased risk of developing EN.
C. Sexual contact - While sexual activity can lead to various infections and conditions, it is not a well-established risk factor for erythema nodosum.
D. Spider bite - A spider bite is unlikely to cause erythema nodosum.

Based on the analysis above, the greatest risk factor for this patient's condition (erythema nodosum) is wool handling due to its potential to cause contact dermatitis.

The final answer is: B
