## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and history, we can deduce that he is experiencing a condition affecting his left eye, possibly an ophthalmological emergency given the acute onset of inability to open the eye and intermittent pain and numbness in the left arm. The key points from the case presentation are:

1. **Inability to open the left eye**: This could indicate a problem with the extraocular muscles or the nerves controlling them.
2. **Intermittent pain and numbness in the left arm**: These symptoms suggest involvement of the brachial plexus, which is often associated with conditions affecting the nerves that control muscle movement.

Considering these points, we can rule out some options:

- **A. Facial asymmetry**: While facial asymmetry could be present due to nerve damage or other conditions, it's not directly related to the symptoms described.
- **B. Loss of hemifacial sweating**: This is more commonly associated with Bell's palsy, which typically presents with unilateral facial weakness and drooping eyelid (ptosis), but the patient's presentation doesn't specifically suggest this.
- **D. Urinary retention**: This symptom would be unusual in a 74-year-old patient without any indication of urinary tract infection or other urological issues.

Given these considerations, we are left with:

**C. Tongue deviation to the left side**: This is a classic sign of Horner's syndrome, which can result from damage to the sympathetic nerves that control pupil constriction and eyelid opening. The patient's symptoms align well with this diagnosis: inability to open his eye (ptosis), intermittent pain and numbness in his arm (which could be related to the brachial plexus), and a normal extraocular muscle movement.

Therefore, the most likely additional clinical feature present in this patient is tongue deviation to the left side.
