Given the symptoms described by the patient after surgery, such as numbness and tingling in the upper part of the scrotum and base of the penis, we need to consider which nerves are responsible for these areas.

The inguinal region is primarily innervated by the ilioinguinal nerve. This nerve originates from the L1-L2 spinal nerve roots and provides sensory innervation to the skin over the pubic symphysis, the root of the penis, and the upper part of the scrotum. The ilioinguinal nerve also supplies motor fibers to the cremaster muscle, which helps to suspend the testes.

The genitofemoral nerve is primarily responsible for sensory innervation of the medial aspect of the thigh and the skin over the labia majora and mons pubis. It does not supply the scrotum or penis.

The iliohypogastric nerve provides sensory innervation to the lower abdominal wall, including the external genitalia, but it is not primarily responsible for the symptoms described in this case.

The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve supplies sensation to the skin over the anterior aspect of the thigh and does not relate to the symptoms presented by the patient.

Therefore, considering the location and nature of the numbness and tingling, the most likely nerve injured during the procedure is the ilioinguinal nerve.
