## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, let's break down the key points:

1. **Weakness in one arm**: The patient reports weakness in his right arm, which has been worsening over a few weeks.
2. **History of smoking and alcohol use**: These factors increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and other conditions that can lead to vascular events.
3. **Use of anabolic steroids**: This is a significant risk factor for vascular events due to its impact on lipid profiles and blood pressure regulation.
4. **Physical exam findings**: Decreased sensation in the right arm, 2/5 strength in the right arm, and 5/5 strength in the left arm are noted. The dull aching and burning pain in the right arm during the exam further supports this diagnosis.

Considering these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Apical lung tumor**: This is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings. Lung tumors would more likely cause chest pain or difficulty breathing rather than isolated arm weakness.

B. **Cerebral infarction**: While cerebral infarctions can cause weakness in one arm, they typically present with a sudden onset of neurological deficits such as numbness, tingling, or paralysis, which are not described here.

C. **Scalenus anticus syndrome**: This condition is characterized by compression of the subclavian artery at the scalene muscles, leading to reduced blood flow to the arm on the affected side. It can cause weakness in the arm and pain during activities that increase blood flow (e.g., lifting). Given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, this diagnosis seems plausible.

D. **Subclavian steal syndrome**: This condition occurs when there is a stenosis or occlusion of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery, leading to reversal of blood flow through the vertebral artery. It can cause weakness in the arm on the affected side and pain during activities that increase blood flow. However, this diagnosis typically presents with symptoms related to vertebral artery compression or stenosis rather than isolated subclavian artery compression.

Based on the patient's presentation and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is **C. Scalenus anticus syndrome**, as it best explains the combination of arm weakness, pain during activities that increase blood flow, and decreased sensation in the affected arm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C
