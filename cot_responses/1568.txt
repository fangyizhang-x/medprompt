(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, including pain during deep inspiration and retrosternal chest pain, tender to palpation around his sternal wound, erythema around the incision without dehiscence, widened mediastinum with a small pleural effusion on the left, and CT angiography findings of stranding in the subcutaneous tissue and a fluid collection below the sternum, we can deduce that the patient is experiencing an infection or abscess formation at the surgical site.

The presence of pain during deep inspiration, which is often associated with pneumothorax or pleural effusion, combined with retrosternal chest pain, suggests that there may be an air leak or accumulation of fluid in the thoracic cavity. The widened mediastinum and small pleural effusion further support this suspicion.

The CT angiography findings of stranding in the subcutaneous tissue and a fluid collection below the sternum are indicative of an abscess formation, which is a collection of pus that has accumulated at the site of infection.

Given these findings, the best next step in management would be to initiate intravenous antibiotics to treat the underlying infection. This will help to reduce the size of the abscess and prevent further complications such as empyema (a condition where fluid accumulates in the pleural space) or mediastinitis (an infection of the tissues surrounding the heart).

Intravenous debridement of the surgical wound may be necessary to remove dead tissue and promote healing, but it is not the immediate next step. Additionally, surgical repair of esophageal perforation (A) or aortic injury (B) would be premature without further evaluation and assessment of the patient's overall condition.

Therefore, the best course of action is to start intravenous antibiotics and observe the patient for a period of time to monitor for any signs of improvement or worsening of symptoms.
