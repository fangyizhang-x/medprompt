Given the clinical presentation of difficulty swallowing and lesions on the palate and tongue that can be easily scraped off, this patient's symptoms are highly suggestive of oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL). OHL is a condition characterized by the growth of white patches on the tongue, palate, and other mucosal surfaces in individuals with weakened immune systems.

The risk factors for OHL include:

- **Chronic immunosuppression**: This can be due to various conditions such as HIV/AIDS, cancer treatment (e.g., chemotherapy), or organ transplantation. The patient's symptoms suggest a compromised immune system.
- **Inhalation of irritants**: Exposure to certain substances like tobacco smoke, chemicals, or other pollutants can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of OHL.

Considering the options provided:

A. Decline in CD4+ T-cells: This is a well-established risk factor for OHL. The patient's symptoms are consistent with this condition, as they have difficulty swallowing (indicative of dysphagia) and lesions on the palate and tongue that can be easily scraped off.

B. Inhalation of salbutamol: Salbutamol is a bronchodilator used to treat asthma and COPD. While it may have some systemic effects, there is no direct link between its inhalation and OHL.

C. Chronic nicotine abuse: Nicotine abuse can lead to various health issues, including oral lesions in some cases (e.g., oral lichen planus). However, the patient's symptoms are more suggestive of immunosuppression rather than chronic nicotine abuse.

D. Epstein-Barr virus infection: While EBV is associated with several conditions, such as infectious mononucleosis and certain types of cancer, it is not a direct risk factor for OHL.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and the known risk factors for oral hairy leukoplakia, the most likely correct answer is:
