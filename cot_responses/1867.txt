## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 3-year-old girl, including diffuse petechiae and purpura, a history of recurrent nosebleeds (epistaxis), and laboratory results indicating thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) with normal peripheral blood smear morphology, we can deduce several key points:

1. **Recurrent Nosebleeds**: This suggests an issue with the coagulation cascade that leads to bleeding into small vessels.
2. **Asthma History**: While asthma is a significant medical history, it does not directly relate to the current presentation of nosebleeds and thrombocytopenia.
3. **Cousin with Hemophilia**: This familial condition indicates a possible inherited coagulation disorder, but in this case, we are focused on the patient's own bleeding issues.

The laboratory results:

- **Bleeding Time (BT)**: 11 minutes is slightly prolonged, which can be seen in several conditions including platelet dysfunction or von Willebrand disease.
- **Prothrombin Time (PT)** and **Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT)**: Both are significantly prolonged, indicating a problem with the intrinsic coagulation pathway. The PTT is particularly notable as it is often used to diagnose conditions like hemophilia A or B, which affect factor VIII.
- **Platelet Count**: 195,000/mm^3 is low for an adult child of asthmatic parents but within the normal range for a child of this age.

Considering these points:

- **A. Decreased levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF)**: This could be a consideration in some bleeding disorders, but it's not directly supported by the provided information.
- **B. Mutation in glycoprotein Ib**: While mutations in glycoproteins involved in platelet adhesion can lead to bleeding disorders, there is no specific indication of this mutation in the provided data.
- **C. Mutation in glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa)**: This is a key component of the platelet aggregation pathway and mutations in GPIIb/IIIa are associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which can present similarly to this patient's condition. TTP is characterized by recurrent microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal
