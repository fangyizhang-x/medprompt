(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and laboratory findings:

1. **Increasing swelling around the eyes for 3 days**: This suggests fluid retention or edema, which can be associated with various conditions including nephrotic syndrome, liver disease, or heart failure.
2. **Periorbital edema and abdominal distention with shifting dullness**: These findings are indicative of ascites, a condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, often due to liver cirrhosis, heart failure, or nephrotic syndrome.
3. **Laboratory studies**:
   - **Serum albumin of 2 g/dL**: This is significantly low, indicating severe protein loss (nephrotic syndrome).
   - **Serum cholesterol concentration of 290 mg/dL**: Elevated cholesterol levels are also characteristic of nephrotic syndrome.
   - **Urinalysis shows 4+ proteinuria and fatty casts**: Proteinuria is a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome, with the presence of fatty casts further supporting this diagnosis.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by heavy proteinuria (more than 3.5 g/1.73 m^2 body surface area per day), hypoalbuminemia (low serum albumin), hyperlipidemia (elevated cholesterol and triglycerides), and edema.

Now, let's consider the histological findings:

- **A. Granular subepithelial deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 on immunofluorescence**: This finding is typical of membranous nephropathy, a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children.
- **B. Mesangial proliferation on light microscopy**: While mesangial proliferation can be seen in various glomerulonephritides, it's not the most specific finding for nephrotic syndrome.
- **C. Deposits of IgG and C3 at the glomerular basement membrane on immunofluorescence**: This is characteristic of membranous nephropathy, which is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children.
- **D. Normal glomeruli on light microscopy**: This finding would be unexpected given the patient's presentation with nephrotic syndrome.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the
