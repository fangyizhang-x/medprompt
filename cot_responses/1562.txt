## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To answer this question, let's consider the role of the CD21 protein in the immune system and how mutations in different parts of the respiratory tract might affect susceptibility to infection.

1. **CD21 Protein Function**: The CD21 protein is a receptor for the complement component C3d, which plays a crucial role in the activation of the alternative complement pathway. This pathway is involved in the clearance of pathogens from the body.

2. **Nasopharyngeal Epithelium**: The nasopharynx is the upper part of the pharynx that connects the nasal cavity to the oropharynx. It contains a rich population of lymphocytes, including B cells and T cells, which are essential for immune responses against pathogens.

3. **Mutation in CD21 Protein**: A mutation in the gene encoding for the CD21 protein would likely disrupt its function as a receptor for C3d. This could impair the ability of the alternative complement pathway to clear pathogens from the body.

4. **Virus Susceptibility**: Given that the mutation affects the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate pathogens, it is more likely to affect susceptibility to viruses that rely on the alternative complement pathway for their pathogenesis.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - A. Rhinovirus: This virus primarily causes respiratory infections such as the common cold. It does not require the alternative complement pathway for its replication or pathogenesis.
   - B. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV): EBV is a herpesvirus that can cause infectious mononucleosis and other conditions. While it does have some immune evasion mechanisms, mutations in CD21 protein are unlikely to affect susceptibility to EBV.
   - C. Cytomegalovirus (CMV): CMV is another herpesvirus that causes cytomegalovirus infection. Like EBV, its pathogenesis is not significantly affected by mutations in the CD21 protein.
   - D. Parvovirus B19: This virus can cause erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) and other conditions. It does not require the alternative complement pathway for its replication or pathogenesis.

Considering these points, the mutation in the CD21 protein is most likely to prevent infection with Rhinovirus, as this virus relies on the alternative complement pathway for its pathogenesis.

The final answer is: A
