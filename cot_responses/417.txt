## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, we can rule out some options first.

- The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However, his current blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg, which is within the normal range.
- The absence of nausea, vomiting, food intake, sweating, or cough suggests that the pain is not related to an acute gastrointestinal issue or a respiratory infection.
- The patient's physical examination findings do not support the presence of musculoskeletal pain (e.g., absent chest tenderness).
- The patient's age and symptoms are consistent with angina pectoris, which is typically caused by myocardial ischemia.

Considering these points, the most likely cause of this patientâ€™s condition is myocardial ischemia. This can be further supported by the fact that the patient experienced chest pain radiating towards his jaw and shoulder, which is a classic symptom of angina.

Therefore, the answer is D.
