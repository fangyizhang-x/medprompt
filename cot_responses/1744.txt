## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation and laboratory results, we can analyze the possible causes step by step:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with severe pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the left leg 2 hours after a femoral artery embolectomy. These symptoms suggest an acute limb ischemia (ALI) or a more severe condition such as a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

2. **Surgical History**: The patient underwent a left femoral artery embolectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove a blockage from the femoral artery. This surgery can lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, or embolism.

3. **Laboratory Results**:
   - Elevated leukocyte count (11,300/mm^3) indicates an inflammatory response.
   - Low platelet count (189,000/mm^3) could be related to the surgical procedure, sepsis, or a coagulopathy.
   - Normal glucose levels and creatinine levels suggest that there is no acute infection or kidney failure at this point.

4. **Physical Examination Findings**:
   - The patient's left lower extremity is swollen, stiff, and tender on palpation, which could indicate inflammation or edema due to the surgical procedure.
   - Dorsiflexion of her left foot causes severe pain in her calf, suggesting that there may be a problem with blood flow to the foot.

5. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - Given the acute presentation and the patient's history of surgery, we can consider several potential causes:
     - **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)**: This is a common complication after surgeries involving deep veins, such as femoral artery embolectomy.
     - **Reperfusion Injury**: While possible post-surgery, it typically presents with more systemic symptoms and might not fully explain the localized findings in this case.
     - **Rhabdomyolysis**: Although this can occur post-surgery due to muscle damage, it would likely present with more severe systemic symptoms such as renal failure or altered mental status.
     - **Cholesterol Embolism**: This is a rare but serious condition that could cause limb ischemia. However, it typically presents with more specific symptoms and signs related to cholesterol emboli.

Considering the patient's presentation, surgical history, and laboratory results, the most likely cause
