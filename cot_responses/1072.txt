The management of superficial spreading melanoma (SSSM) after an excisional biopsy involves several steps to ensure complete removal of the tumor and to minimize the risk of recurrence.

Firstly, it is essential to confirm that the lesion is indeed SSM. This can be done through histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen. If the diagnosis is confirmed, the next step should focus on ensuring adequate surgical margins.

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) guidelines recommend a minimum margin width of 1-2 cm for excisional biopsies of melanoma to reduce the risk of local recurrence. Therefore, option B (Surgical excision with 1-2 cm safety margins only) is the most appropriate next step in management.

Option A (Surgical excision with 0.5-1 cm safety margins only) may not provide adequate margins, increasing the risk of local recurrence. Option D (Surgical excision with 0.5-1 cm safety margins and sentinel lymph node study) is also inadequate as it does not address the need for adequate surgical margins.

Option C (Surgical excision with 1-2 cm safety margins and sentinel lymph node study) may be considered if there are concerns about the adequacy of the margins, but it should still include a sentinel lymph node biopsy to assess for metastasis. However, given that the lesion is confirmed as SSM, this option may not be necessary.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management after an excisional biopsy of superficial spreading melanoma is surgical excision with 1-2 cm safety margins only.
