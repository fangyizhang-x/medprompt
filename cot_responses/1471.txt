Given the clinical presentation of this 53-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus, recurrent episodes of nausea, tremors, and excessive sweating, along with her history of self-measured blood glucose levels below 50 mg/dL on several occasions, it is essential to consider alternative causes for her symptoms beyond metformin. The presence of borderline personality disorder in the family history also raises the possibility of a genetic component to her condition.

The most appropriate next step in management would be to measure serum C-peptide concentration (Option D). Here's why:

- Metformin is a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, and its efficacy can be monitored through blood glucose levels. However, measuring serum C-peptide concentration provides additional information about the body's ability to produce insulin.
- Elevated serum C-peptide levels are indicative of endogenous insulin production, which can occur in individuals with type 1 diabetes or certain cases of type 2 diabetes due to pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. In this case, it suggests that the patient may have an autoimmune component to her condition, as seen in borderline personality disorder.
- Measuring serum C-peptide concentration is a non-invasive test that does not require any additional medications or equipment beyond what would be used for routine blood glucose monitoring.

The other options are less appropriate:

A. Asking the patient if she is taking any medications other than metformin may provide some information, but it will likely reveal nothing new and may even lead to unnecessary testing.

B. Searching the patient's belongings for insulin is not only unnecessary but also potentially invasive and could cause distress.

C. Measuring glycated hemoglobin concentration (HbA1c) is a measure of average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months, which is useful for assessing long-term control of diabetes. However, it does not provide information about current or recent insulin production.

Therefore, measuring serum C-peptide concentration is the most appropriate next step in management to help diagnose and potentially treat this patient's condition.
