Given the patient's presentation of nausea, vomiting, and low blood pressure (hypotension), along with her history of marijuana use, it is essential to consider the potential for substance-induced gastrointestinal bleeding or other causes that may require immediate attention. The presence of conjunctival injection (redness of the eyes) also suggests possible dehydration.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with a condition known as "marijuana poisoning," which can cause nausea, vomiting, and hypotension due to its effects on the body's fluid balance and blood pressure regulation. However, it is crucial to differentiate between acute marijuana poisoning and other causes of these symptoms.

Option A (urine toxin screen) may be useful in some cases of suspected substance abuse or poisoning but is not the most appropriate initial step given the patient's presentation and lack of clear evidence for a specific toxic substance.

Option B (administer ondansetron per oral and provide oral rehydration solution) addresses the nausea and vomiting, which are likely related to the marijuana use. However, it does not directly address the potential hypotension or dehydration that could be contributing to these symptoms.

Option C (administer ondansetron and isotonic saline with potassium) is a more comprehensive approach. Ondansetron is an antiemetic medication that can help alleviate nausea and vomiting. Isotonic saline provides essential fluids, which are crucial for maintaining blood pressure and hydration. Potassium supplementation may be necessary to address potential hypokalemia (low potassium levels), which can occur in cases of dehydration or excessive fluid loss.

Option D (administer ondansetron and 1/2 normal saline with dextrose) is similar to option C but includes additional measures to address the patient's hydration status. The addition of dextrose provides an energy source, which may be beneficial given the patient's low glucose level (80 mg/dL).

Considering these factors, the most appropriate next step in management would be to administer ondansetron and isotonic saline with potassium to address the nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and dehydration. This comprehensive approach addresses potential causes of these symptoms while also providing essential fluids and electrolytes.

The final answer is: C
