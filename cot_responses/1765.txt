The clinical presentation of this 5-year-old boy, including episodes of staring into space that are precipitated by specific actions (blowing at a pinwheel), is highly suggestive of absence seizures. Absence seizures are characterized by brief, sudden lapses in consciousness, often accompanied by a blank stare or "staring into space." These episodes typically last only a few seconds and are not confused after the episode.

The EEG findings of 3-Hz spike and wave pattern are also consistent with absence seizures. The absence seizure is a type of epilepsy that involves a sudden loss of consciousness without any postictal confusion, which is in contrast to other types of seizures like tonic-clonic or myoclonic seizures.

Given the diagnosis of absence seizures, the best treatment option would be Ethosuximide (A). Ethosuximide is a first-line medication for the treatment of absence seizures and has been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of these episodes. It works by inhibiting sodium channels in the brain, which helps to prevent the abnormal electrical discharges that characterize absence seizures.

The other options are not as suitable for this patient:

- Levetiracetam (B) is an antiepileptic medication that can be used for various types of epilepsy, but it is not typically the first choice for absence seizures.
- Lamotrigine (C) is also an antiepileptic medication that can be used for a variety of seizure types, including absence seizures. However, it may take several weeks to start working effectively and may have more side effects than Ethosuximide.
- Zonisamide (D) is another antiepileptic medication that can be used for various types of epilepsy, but it is not typically the first choice for absence seizures.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and EEG findings, the best treatment option for this patient with absence seizures is Ethosuximide.
