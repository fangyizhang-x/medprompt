Given the patient's presentation with chest pain that is relieved by rest, this suggests angina pectoris, which is typically caused by coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient's current medication regimen includes aspirin, which is standard for primary prevention in patients at high risk of CAD. However, his blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits, suggesting that he does not currently have acute coronary syndrome.

The presence of regular heart sounds and clear lung sounds bilateral on physical examination further supports the diagnosis of angina pectoris without evidence of acute coronary syndrome or other conditions such as pulmonary embolism.

Considering the patient's age (73 years) and the fact that his symptoms are relieved by rest, it is reasonable to consider a medication regimen that aims to reduce ischemia during exertion while minimizing the risk of adverse effects. 

Option A (Amlodipine daily. Sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.) includes a calcium channel blocker (Amlodipine) which can help to reduce myocardial oxygen demand by dilating coronary arteries and reducing vascular resistance, thereby providing symptom relief during exertion. However, it does not address the underlying risk of CAD.

Option B (Metoprolol and a statin daily. Sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.) includes a beta-blocker (Metoprolol) which can help to reduce myocardial oxygen demand by reducing heart rate and contractility, thereby providing symptom relief during exertion. It also includes a statin, which is beneficial for reducing cholesterol levels and preventing further cardiovascular events.

Option C (Metoprolol and ranolazine daily. Sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.) includes a beta-blocker (Metoprolol) and a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (Ranolazine), both of which can help to reduce myocardial oxygen demand by reducing heart rate and contractility, thereby providing symptom relief during exertion.

Option D (Amlodipine and a statin daily. Sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.) includes the same medication regimen as Option A but adds a statin, which is beneficial for reducing cholesterol levels and preventing further cardiovascular events.

Given these considerations, the best initial medication regimen would be to add Metoprolol (Option B or C) and a statin (Option B or C), as both options provide symptom relief during exertion while addressing the underlying risk
