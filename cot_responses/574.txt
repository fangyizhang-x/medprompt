## Step 1: Understand the context of the problem
The colleague is looking for a way to address the issue of whether there's a clinically relevant association between beta-carotene supplementation and heart disease, given that one study found no such association.

## Step 2: Identify the type of study needed
Given that we are dealing with observational data (studies on existing research) and we want to determine if there is an association between two variables (beta-carotene and heart disease), a meta-analysis is the most suitable study design. A meta-analysis combines the results from multiple studies to draw more general conclusions.

## Step 3: Eliminate other options
- Randomized control trials (A) are used for clinical interventions, not observational studies.
- Case-cohort studies (B) involve selecting cases and controls based on a specific characteristic, which is not applicable here since we're looking at the association between two variables across multiple studies.
- Cross-sectional studies (D) look at the relationship between variables at one point in time but do not allow for temporal ordering or causality.

## Step 4: Confirm the recommendation
Given that the goal is to pool results from various studies and determine if there's a clinically relevant association, the meta-analysis is the most appropriate study design.

The final answer is: C
