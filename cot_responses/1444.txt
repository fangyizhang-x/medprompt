## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, including fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, abdominal pain, and purplish discoloration near the incision site, it is highly suggestive of a wound infection. The presence of severe pain, crackling sounds upon palpation, and the specific location of the purplish discoloration are particularly concerning for an infected wound.

The laboratory findings also support this diagnosis, with elevated leukocyte count indicating an inflammatory response, increased creatine kinase levels suggesting muscle damage (possibly from the surgical procedure), and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) indicating inflammation.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate next step in management would be to address the wound infection. Vacuum-assisted wound closure device (VAWC) is a recommended treatment for infected wounds due to its ability to promote healing while minimizing the risk of further complications such as dehiscence or wound breakdown. This option addresses the likely cause of the patient's symptoms and is generally considered safe in most patients.

The other options are not immediately indicated based on the provided information:

- X-ray of the abdomen and pelvis (A) may be useful for assessing the extent of the infection but is not the immediate next step.
- Surgical debridement (C) might be necessary if there were signs of severe tissue damage or necrosis, but it would not address the likely cause of the patient's symptoms.
- Intravenous clindamycin therapy (D) may be considered for antibiotic prophylaxis in certain cases of wound infection, but it is not the most appropriate initial treatment based on the information provided.

Therefore, the best course of action is to initiate treatment with a vacuum-assisted wound closure device.
