## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can analyze the possible diagnoses as follows:

1. **Severe abdominal pain, cramping, nausea, vomiting, and pain with urination** suggest a condition that affects the lower abdomen and urinary tract.
2. **Sexually active with inconsistent condom use**, which increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
3. **Burning pain during sexual intercourse 3 days ago** is a significant clue, as it suggests pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), particularly given the patient's recent sexual activity.
4. **Cervical motion tenderness and purulent cervical discharge on pelvic examination** are indicative of PID, which can cause inflammation of the cervix and surrounding tissues.
5. **Laboratory studies showing leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)** further support the presence of an inflammatory process.

Considering these findings, we can rule out some options:

- **Appendicitis** is less likely due to the patient's recent sexual activity and the absence of abdominal pain or tenderness.
- **Pyelonephritis**, while possible, is not as strongly supported by the physical examination findings (e.g., no mention of flank pain) and laboratory results.

Given the evidence, the most likely diagnosis is:

**D. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)**

The presence of cervical motion tenderness, purulent cervical discharge, and a history of recent sexual activity increase the risk of PID. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with PID, which can cause severe abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, and pelvic pain.

Therefore, the answer is D.
