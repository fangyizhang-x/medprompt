## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Firstly, let's consider the scenario presented to us. The patient is experiencing symptoms such as high fever, chills, malaise, headaches, and myalgias, which are consistent with a viral infection. However, he also mentions that his friends came down with the same symptoms last week, suggesting that this might be an infectious disease.

The physician's statement about the virus being particularly infectious and causing a global pandemic is also relevant. This implies that the virus has some unique properties that enable it to spread rapidly across different populations.

Now, let's analyze the options provided:

A. Concurrent infection with 2 viruses: While concurrent infections can lead to more severe outcomes, this option doesn't directly address the question of why the same virus can infect people who have already had the disease and cause a global pandemic.

B. Crossing over of homologous regions: This is a process that occurs during meiosis in sexual reproduction, which is not relevant to viral infections or pandemics.

C. One virus that produces a non-functional protein: This option doesn't make sense in the context of the question. If one virus produced a non-functional protein, it would likely have no effect on the host's immune response or disease progression.

D. Segmented genomic material: Viruses are typically single-stranded RNA or DNA viruses, and their genetic material is usually segmented. However, some viruses can have linear or circular genomes. The segmented nature of viral genomes is a key factor in enabling them to infect different cells and cause pandemics. For example, influenza A virus has a segmented genome that allows it to mutate rapidly and evade the host's immune system.

Therefore, considering the unique properties required for global pandemics of this virus, the correct answer is:

The segmented genomic material (D)
