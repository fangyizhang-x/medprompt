Firstly, it is essential to acknowledge that the patient has expressed a clear wish to undergo vasectomy, which is a personal and informed decision. The physician should respect this choice while also considering the potential impact on the patient's wife.

The primary concern here is to ensure that both patients are fully informed about the procedure, its benefits, risks, and alternatives. This approach aligns with the principles of shared decision-making in medicine, where patients and their healthcare providers collaborate to make informed decisions about their care.

Option A (insist that the patient returns with his wife to discuss the risks and benefits of the procedure together) is not the most appropriate initial response. While it's essential to involve both parties in the discussion, simply requiring them to return together may not be sufficient to address the patient's concerns or provide adequate information about the procedure.

Option C (call the patient's wife to obtain her consent for the procedure) might be premature without first discussing the risks and benefits of vasectomy with the patient. This approach could lead to unnecessary delays in obtaining informed consent from the patient, who has already expressed his desire to undergo the procedure.

Option D (discourage the patient from undergoing the procedure because his wife wants children) is not only unprofessional but also potentially discriminatory. The physician should avoid making decisions based on a patient's marital status or family plans. Instead, they should focus on ensuring that both patients are fully informed and able to make an autonomous decision about their care.

Therefore, the most appropriate action by the physician regarding this patient's wish to undergo vasectomy is to explain the procedure's benefits, alternatives, and potential complications in a clear and unbiased manner. This approach respects the patient's autonomy while also ensuring that both parties have access to accurate information to make an informed decision about their care.

The final answer is: B
