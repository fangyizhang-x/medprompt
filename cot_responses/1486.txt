## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, fatigue, worsening cough, increased sputum production, weight gain, and physical exam findings of cyanosis, edema in legs, wheezing, and a prolonged expiratory phase, we can deduce that this patient likely has Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or possibly another obstructive lung disease.

The presence of shortness of breath, fatigue, and increased sputum production are classic symptoms of COPD. The physical exam findings of cyanosis and edema in the legs also support this diagnosis.

On a chest radiograph, several features can be expected based on the patient's clinical presentation:

- **A. Calcified pleural plaques surrounding the diaphragm**: This is more typical of asbestos exposure or chronic mesothelioma rather than COPD.
- **B. Cardiomegaly and increased bronchial markings**: While cardiomegaly can be seen in various conditions, including heart failure, it's not a direct consequence of COPD. Increased bronchial markings are also more typical of asthma or other inflammatory lung diseases.
- **C. Hyperinflated lungs and loss of lung markings**: This is characteristic of emphysema, which is the most common form of COPD. The patient's symptoms (shortness of breath, fatigue) and physical exam findings (wheezing, prolonged expiratory phase) are consistent with emphysema.
- **D. Perihilar mass with unilateral hilar enlargement**: This finding is more typical of lung cancer or other masses rather than COPD.

Therefore, the most likely feature seen on a chest radiograph in this patient would be hyperinflated lungs and loss of lung markings, which are characteristic of emphysema, a common complication of COPD.
