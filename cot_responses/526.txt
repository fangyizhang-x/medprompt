## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The key to answering this question lies in understanding the prognostic factors of melanoma, which are crucial for determining the risk and management plan for patients with skin lesions suspicious for melanoma.

Firstly, it's essential to recognize that the patient's concern about her mother's passing from melanoma is a valid one. However, the presence of an abnormal skin lesion warrants further evaluation rather than immediate concern for her family history.

Now, let's evaluate each option in terms of its prognostic significance:

A. Evolution of lesion over time: While changes in the appearance or size of the lesion can be concerning, they are not the most significant prognostic factor. The evolution of a melanoma is more related to the growth pattern and characteristics of the tumor rather than the overall prognosis.

B. Age at presentation: Age alone is not a reliable predictor of prognosis for melanoma. While older adults may have a higher risk due to other comorbidities, age is not a critical factor in determining the outcome.

C. Depth of invasion of atypical cells: This option refers to the Breslow depth or Clark level, which measures the depth of invasion of the melanoma into the skin. A deeper invasion (Breslow depth > 1 mm) is associated with a higher risk of metastasis and poorer prognosis. However, this factor alone does not fully capture the prognostic significance.

D. Level of irregularity of the borders: This option refers to the shape or border irregularity of the melanoma, which can be assessed using the Clark level system (1-4). A more irregular border is associated with a higher risk of metastasis and poorer prognosis. The level of irregularity is considered one of the most significant prognostic factors for melanoma.

Therefore, considering the options provided, the most important prognostic factor of melanoma in this scenario is the level of irregularity of the borders, as it directly correlates with the risk of malignant transformation and metastasis.

The final answer is: D
