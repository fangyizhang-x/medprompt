## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's consider what we know about the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and IQ scores.

1. Historically, IQ scores have been reported to be distributed normally with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.
2. This means that most people are expected to score around 100 on an IQ test.
3. However, there is evidence to suggest that SES can affect IQ scores, although the relationship is complex and influenced by many factors.

Now, let's consider what happens when we increase the sample size from 300 to 2000 participants:

1. With a larger sample size, we are more likely to detect small effects of SES on IQ scores.
2. This is because a larger sample size provides more precise estimates of the population parameters (mean and standard deviation).
3. As a result, we may be able to identify relationships between SES and IQ scores that were not apparent with a smaller sample size.

Given these considerations, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. Decrease in standard deviation: Increasing the sample size will actually increase the precision of our estimates, which means that the standard deviation will decrease.

B. Decrease in standard error of the mean: The standard error of the mean (SEM) is a measure of how much the sample mean deviates from the population mean. With a larger sample size, we get more precise estimates of both the population mean and the standard deviation, which means that our SEM will decrease.

C. Increase in risk of systematic error: Systematic error occurs when there is a consistent bias in the data collection process. Increasing the sample size reduces the impact of systematic errors because it provides more representative samples.

D. Increase in probability of type II error: Type II error occurs when we fail to detect an effect that exists in the population. With a larger sample size, we are more likely to detect small effects of SES on IQ scores, which means that our power to detect an effect increases.

Therefore, the most likely outcome is:

The final answer is: B
