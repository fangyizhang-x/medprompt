## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Initial Presentation and Diagnosis
The patient presents with a 3-week history of fatigue, night sweats, enlarged lymph nodes, persistent fever, ipsilateral hilar enlargement on chest X-ray, and a rounded calcified focus near the right hilum. These symptoms are highly suggestive of tuberculosis (TB), particularly pulmonary TB given the location of the hilar enlargement and the presence of acid-fast bacilli in sputum samples.

The positive Mantoux test further supports this diagnosis, as it indicates exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

### Treatment Initiation
Given the patient's presentation and the need for effective treatment of TB, she is started on a 4-drug regimen. The most commonly used regimens include Isoniazid (INH) + Rifampicin (RIF) + Pyrazinamide (PZA) + Ethambutol (EMB).

### Post-Treatment Presentation
After 6 months of treatment, the patient returns with complaints of joint pain, a skin rash that worsens with sunlight and malaise. These symptoms are indicative of drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE), a known side effect of certain anti-tuberculosis drugs.

The presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-histone antibodies further supports this diagnosis, as they are commonly found in DILE.

### Drug Identification
Among the options provided:
- A. Rifampicin is a key component of the standard TB treatment regimen but can cause drug-induced lupus erythematosus.
- B. Isoniazid is also part of the standard TB treatment and can cause DILE, making it a likely candidate for this patient's symptoms.
- C. Ethambutol is another component of the TB treatment regimen but is less commonly associated with DILE compared to Rifampicin.
- D. Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used in TB treatment and is not typically associated with DILE.

Given the clinical presentation and the known side effects of these drugs, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is Isoniazid, which can precipitate drug-induced lupus erythematosus.
