## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's presentation suggests a sympathetic nervous system (SNS) response to the epidural anesthesia, which is causing her heart rate increase and hypotension.

1. The initial hemodynamic response to lidocaine with epinephrine is not significant enough to cause concern for SNS blockade or local anesthetic systemic toxicity.
2. However, after starting a continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.0625%, the patient exhibits a significant drop in blood pressure (80/50 mmHg) and heart rate increase from 90 bpm to 120 bpm. This suggests that the SNS is being activated.
3. The Bainbridge reflex is a response to hypotension, characterized by an increase in heart rate and peripheral vasoconstriction. It is typically seen with vasodilators or other causes of hypotension that do not involve sympathetic blockade.
4. Intrathecal infiltration of local anesthetic can cause SNS blockade, leading to hypotension and tachycardia. However, this would likely be accompanied by a more pronounced hemodynamic response to the local anesthetic itself, which is not seen in this case.
5. Local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) typically presents with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and neurological symptoms like numbness or tingling. The patient's presentation does not suggest LAST.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the hemodynamic change is sympathetic blockade, which is consistent with the Bainbridge reflex. This is because the bupivacaine infusion is causing a significant drop in blood pressure and heart rate increase without any other apparent cause for these symptoms.

The answer choice that best explains this scenario is therefore D. Sympathetic blockade.
