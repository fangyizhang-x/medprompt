## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario:

1. **Symptoms and Triggers**: The patient experiences intermittent episodes of substernal chest pain and shortness of breath that occur only when walking up stairs. These symptoms are suggestive of angina pectoris, a condition characterized by myocardial ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart muscle) triggered by physical exertion.

2. **Impact on Work**: The patient's inability to work due to chest pain is a significant concern, indicating that his condition has affected his quality of life.

3. **Physical Examination and ECG Findings**: The unremarkable physical examination and normal ECG do not provide specific clues about the underlying cause of his symptoms.

4. **Medication Consideration**: We are looking for a medication that blocks a receptor to prevent future episodes of chest pain from occurring.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors**: These receptors are involved in various physiological processes, including vasoconstriction and modulation of sympathetic tone. However, blocking alpha-2 adrenergic receptors is not typically associated with preventing angina pectoris.

B. **Angiotensin II receptors**: Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that plays a key role in regulating blood pressure. While it has various effects on the cardiovascular system, blocking its receptors is not a primary treatment for angina pectoris.

C. **Aldosterone receptors**: Aldosterone is involved in sodium and potassium balance, which can affect blood pressure and cardiac function. However, blocking aldosterone receptors is not commonly used to treat angina pectoris.

D. **Beta-1 adrenergic receptors**: Beta-1 adrenergic receptors are primarily found in the heart, where they mediate positive inotropic effects (increased contractility) and vasodilation. Blocking beta-1 adrenergic receptors is a well-established treatment for angina pectoris. This class of medications, known as beta-blockers, works by reducing myocardial oxygen demand through several mechanisms, including decreased heart rate, reduced cardiac output, and vasodilation.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the pathophysiology of angina pectoris, the most likely medication to block is beta-1 adrenergic receptors.
