To solve this problem, we need to understand the genetics of X-linked recessive disorders.

Red-green color blindness is an X-linked recessive disorder, which means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). Since males only have one X chromosome, they are more likely to express the condition if they inherit a mutated gene from their mother.

Let's break down the information given:

* The incidence of red-green color blindness in males is 1/200.
* Males can only inherit one copy of the mutated gene (one X chromosome with the mutation).
* Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes. If they inherit one normal X chromosome and one X chromosome with the mutation, they will be phenotypically normal.

To calculate the probability that a phenotypically normal male and female have a child with red-green color blindness:

1. The probability of a male inheriting the mutated gene is 1/200.
2. If a male inherits the mutated gene, he will express the condition (red-green color blindness). Therefore, the probability of him having a child with red-green color blindness is 1/200.
3. Since males only have one X chromosome, if they inherit the mutated gene, their daughter will be phenotypically normal and their son will be affected (if they inherit two copies of the mutated gene).
4. The probability that a female inherits two normal X chromosomes (i.e., she is phenotypically normal) is 1/2.
5. If a female inherits two normal X chromosomes, her daughter will be phenotypically normal and her son will be affected (if he inherits one mutated X chromosome and one normal X chromosome).
6. The probability of the father being phenotypically normal is 1/2.

Now, let's calculate the probability that both parents are phenotypically normal:

* Probability of a male being phenotypically normal: 1/200
* Probability of a female being phenotypically normal: 1/2

Since these events are independent (the gender of the child does not affect their likelihood of inheriting the mutated gene), we can multiply the probabilities together:
(1/200) Ã— (1/2) = 1/400

Therefore, the probability that a phenotypically normal male and
