## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, we can analyze the possible causes step by step:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with left-sided flank pain, fever (36.9Â°C), tachycardia (89/min), hypotension (118/75 mm Hg), and a history of recent sigmoid resection for acute diverticulitis. These symptoms suggest an infectious or inflammatory process.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient has thrombocytopenia (low platelet count, 170,000/mm3) with no other abnormalities in the complete blood count (CBC). The coagulation studies show prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which is a key finding.

   - **Prolonged PTT** suggests an issue with the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. This can be caused by various factors, including deficiencies or inhibitors of clotting factors.
   
   - **Thrombocytopenia** could be related to several conditions, but in this context, it's more likely due to a bleeding disorder rather than a platelet destruction process.

3. **Recent Surgery**: The patient had sigmoid resection for acute diverticulitis 8 days ago. This is crucial because recent surgery can lead to postoperative complications such as thrombocytopenia and prolonged PTT.

4. **Spider Angiomas, Hematoma, and Bruises**: These findings are indicative of a coagulation disorder or platelet dysfunction. Spider angiomas suggest a problem with the production of clotting factors, while the hematoma and bruises could be related to bleeding disorders.

5. **Impaired Factor VII Activation**: Given the recent surgery and the presence of spider angiomas, impaired activation of factor VII is a plausible explanation for the prolonged PTT. Factor VII is essential for initiating the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. Impaired activation or deficiency in this factor can lead to an accumulation of tissue thromboplastin, resulting in a prolonged PTT.

Considering these points, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's current symptoms is impaired activation of factor VII due to its recent surgical intervention.

The final answer is: B
