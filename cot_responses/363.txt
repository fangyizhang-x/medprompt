## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Step 1: Assess the patient's symptoms and history to identify potential causes.
The patient presents with bilateral eye pain, red eyes, opacification and ulceration of each cornea, and a history of unprotected sex. These symptoms are highly suggestive of acute endophthalmitis, an infection within the eye.

### Step 2: Consider the patient's recent activities as a predisposing factor.
The patient admits to going out this past weekend and drinking large amounts of alcohol, which increases the risk for infections such as endophthalmitis. Additionally, having unprotected sex also raises the risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that can cause endophthalmitis.

### Step 3: Evaluate the physical exam findings.
The slit lamp exam shows bilateral corneal ulceration, which is consistent with endophthalmitis. The presence of opacification and ulceration of each cornea further supports this diagnosis.

### Step 4: Consider the treatment options provided.
A. Acyclovir - This antiviral medication is primarily used to treat viral infections such as herpes simplex keratitis, not bacterial endophthalmitis.
B. Gatifloxacin eye drops - This antibiotic is effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including some that cause endophthalmitis. However, it may not be the best choice for this patient due to potential side effects and the need for intravitreal treatment.
C. Intravitreal vancomycin and ceftazidime - These antibiotics are effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively, including some that cause endophthalmitis. Vancomycin is particularly useful in treating endophthalmitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
D. Topical dexamethasone and refrain from wearing contacts - While topical corticosteroids can be used to reduce inflammation, they are not the primary treatment for bacterial endophthalmitis.

### Step 5: Choose the best treatment option based on the patient's condition.
Given the potential severity of the infection and the need for intravitreal treatment, option C (Intravitreal vancomycin and ceftazidime) is the most appropriate choice. This combination of antibiotics provides broad-spectrum coverage and is effective against common causes of endophthalmitis.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
