## Step 1: Assess the patient's risk for tetanus exposure
The patient has a puncture wound on his left shin that is contaminated with soil, which increases his risk of tetanus infection.

## Step 2: Consider the patient's vaccination history
Although the patient received the Tdap vaccine several times since his last tetanus booster, he does not remember when he last received it. The Tdap vaccine typically provides immunity against tetanus for 10 years or more after the final dose.

## Step 3: Evaluate the patient's current condition and risk factors
The patient is mildly dyspneic and pale, which could indicate a systemic infection or anemia. However, his vital signs are stable, and he does not have severe respiratory distress. The presence of tetanus toxin in the wound increases his risk for tetanus.

## Step 4: Determine the appropriate approach to post-exposure prevention
Given the patient's risk factors (tetanus exposure due to contaminated soil) and lack of immunity from recent vaccination, the most effective approach is to provide both tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine and human tetanus immunoglobulin.

## Step 5: Consider the contraindications for tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine administration
Human tetanus immunoglobulin (ITIG) can be administered in cases where there are no contraindications, such as acute illness or fever. Therefore, option A is not a correct answer.

## Step 6: Evaluate the patient's vaccination history and potential need for booster doses
The patient has received multiple Tdap vaccines since his last tetanus booster, which suggests that he may be at risk of tetanus infection due to incomplete immunity from previous vaccinations.

## Step 7: Determine the most appropriate course of action
Given the patient's risk factors and lack of immunity from recent vaccination, providing both tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine and human tetanus immunoglobulin is the most effective approach to prevent tetanus post-exposure.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
