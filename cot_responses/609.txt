Given the clinical presentation of this 6-year-old girl, we can deduce that she likely has a viral exanthem, given her age and the description of the rash. The presence of fluid oozing from some lesions and crusted lesions with vesicles also supports this diagnosis.

The fact that she was treated with azithromycin for an episode of bronchitis 4 months ago raises concerns about potential antibiotic resistance or side effects. However, there is no clear indication of a bacterial infection at this time.

Considering the patient's symptoms and laboratory results (elevated leukocyte count), we should look for viral causes that could explain these findings. Among the options provided:

- Vitamin A therapy (A) is typically used to treat scabies or other skin infestations, which are not indicated in this case.
- Rapid strep test (B) would be more appropriate if there were signs of a bacterial infection such as high fever, purulent discharge, or significant swelling. However, the patient's symptoms do not support this diagnosis.
- Tzanck test (C) is used to diagnose herpes simplex virus infections, which can cause vesicular rashes. Given the presence of crusted lesions and vesicles, this test could be a reasonable next step.
- Calamine lotion (D) is often used to treat mild skin conditions such as eczema or dermatitis but does not address the underlying cause of the rash.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate next best step would be to perform a Tzanck test to help diagnose a viral etiology for this patient's symptoms.
