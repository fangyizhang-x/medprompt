The key to this question is understanding the clinical presentation and how it relates to the possible answers.

First, let's analyze the patient's symptoms:
- Unexplained hypertension in a 9-year-old girl.
- Significant decrease in activity levels over the past year.
- Physical exam findings include a clicking sound around systole (a murmur), which could be indicative of aortic stenosis or other cardiac abnormalities. However, the absence of a palpable pulse at the neck level suggests that the condition might not be severe enough to cause significant hemodynamic compromise.

Now, let's consider the possible answers and how they relate to this clinical presentation:

A. Cleft palate - This is a congenital anomaly that can affect growth and development but is not directly related to hypertension or cardiac murmurs.

B. Prominent occiput - An occiput with a prominent posterior fontanelle (a soft spot on the back of the head) might be associated with conditions like hydrocephalus, which could indirectly relate to decreased activity levels due to increased intracranial pressure. However, this is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

C. Long philtrum - A long philtrum can be a sign of Turner syndrome or other genetic conditions but is not directly related to hypertension or cardiac murmurs.

D. Webbed neck - This is a physical exam finding that is often associated with Down syndrome, among other conditions. It can also be seen in individuals with Turner syndrome and other genetic disorders. Given the patient's symptoms of unexplained hypertension and decreased activity levels, a webbed neck could indicate an underlying condition such as polycystic kidney disease (PKD), which is a common cause of hypertension in children.

Given this analysis, the physical exam finding that was most likely missed by both the medical student and primary care physician is D. Webbed neck, due to its association with conditions like PKD, which can cause unexplained hypertension and decreased activity levels.
