## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Firstly, let's consider each option step by step:

A. This statement is incorrect because erythroblastosis fetalis can occur with an Rh-positive mother and an Rh-negative father. The condition occurs when there is a mismatch between the blood types of the mother and the fetus.

B. While Rho(D) immune globulin (RhD IgG) is often administered to Rh-negative mothers who are pregnant with an Rh-positive fetus, this is typically done in the third trimester or after birth, not during the first trimester. The goal is to prevent the formation of antibodies against RhD antigen in the mother's blood that could cross the placenta and cause hemolysis in the fetus.

C. This statement is incorrect because the combination of an Rh-positive mother and an Rh-negative fetus does not cause erythroblastosis fetalis. Erythroblastosis fetalis occurs when there is a direct transfusion of fetal red cells into the mother's bloodstream, which can happen if the mother has anti-Rh antibodies.

D. This statement is correct because IgM crosses the placenta and causes erythrocyte hemolysis in the fetus due to pre-existing Rh-negative blood type. When an Rh-positive mother becomes pregnant with an Rh-negative fetus, her immune system produces antibodies against the Rh antigen on the fetus's red blood cells. These antibodies can cross the placenta and bind to the fetal red blood cells, marking them for destruction.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.
