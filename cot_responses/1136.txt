(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, we can deduce that this is a case of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), specifically a duodenal ulcer.

The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain that worsens at night are classic for PUD. The fact that the vomit was non-bilious and did not contain any blood is also consistent with a peptic ulcer, as bleeding from a gastric source would typically be bilious.

The patient's history of frequent episodes of vague epigastric pain that often wakes her up during the night further supports this diagnosis. This type of pain is often referred to as "heartburn" or "epigastric pain," and it can be associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Over the counter omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), has been shown to provide relief from symptoms such as epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting in patients with PUD. This is because PPIs reduce gastric acid production, which can help alleviate symptoms.

The patient's recent history of anorexia and early satiety may be related to her peptic ulcer disease, as these conditions are often associated with decreased stomach acid production (hypochlorhydria) or reduced gastric emptying rate. This can lead to delayed gastric emptying and increased pressure in the stomach, which can exacerbate symptoms of PUD.

The fact that ibuprofen provides some relief from her symptoms is also consistent with a peptic ulcer, as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen can reduce gastric acid production and alleviate symptoms such as pain and nausea.

Blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate are all within normal limits, which does not suggest any underlying cardiovascular or respiratory conditions that could be contributing to her symptoms.

Therefore, the most consistent findings with a duodenal ulcer in this patient are non-bilious vomiting (A), early satiety (B), relief from symptoms with omeprazole (C), and grossly distended abdomen on physical examination (D).
