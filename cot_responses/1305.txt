(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, which includes absent fetal movements at 26 weeks' gestation without vaginal bleeding or discharge, a soft cervix with a cervical os measuring 3 cm, and ultrasound findings of no cardiac activity in the fetus, the most appropriate next step is to plan for oxytocin administration. This is because the absence of fetal movements and the presence of absent cardiac activity suggest that the fetus may be non-viable or have died.

The patient's history of type 1 diabetes mellitus controlled with insulin does not directly impact the management of this situation, as the decision to perform a cesarean delivery would depend on other factors such as the gestational age and the presence of any fetal anomalies.

Performing a dilation and curettage (D&C) or performing a cesarean delivery without first administering oxytocin is not appropriate in this scenario. D&C carries a risk of uterine rupture, especially in women with a history of diabetes. Cesarean delivery may be considered if the patient's condition warrants it, but oxytocin administration would be a more immediate and effective way to induce labor.

Administering magnesium sulfate (C) is not relevant to this situation as there are no indications for its use in obstetrics.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to plan for oxytocin administration to facilitate induction of labor.
