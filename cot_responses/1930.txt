(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of progressive left-sided scrotal pain, vomiting, and a history of sexually active behavior with inconsistent condom use, there are several potential causes to consider. The presence of testicular cancer in the family history is also a significant concern.

Firstly, let's evaluate the options:

A. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis: While a CT scan can be useful for evaluating abdominal and pelvic pathology, it is not typically the first step in managing scrotal pain or swelling. The patient's symptoms are more suggestive of an acute testicular condition rather than a systemic illness.

B. Surgical exploration: This option is highly invasive and usually reserved for cases where there is a clear indication of a life-threatening emergency, such as a ruptured hernia or a severe abdominal injury. Given the patient's presentation, there is no clear indication that surgical exploration is necessary at this time.

C. Scrotal ultrasonography: This is a non-invasive and relatively quick test that can help to confirm the diagnosis of an acute testicular condition such as epididymitis, orchitis, or testicular torsion. Given the patient's symptoms of scrotal pain, swelling, and tenderness, this option is highly appropriate.

D. Measurement of serum mumps IgG titer: While it is true that there is a familial component to testicular cancer (e.g., the patient's father was diagnosed with testicular cancer at age 51), measuring serum mumps IgG titers would not provide any direct information about the patient's current condition or risk for testicular cancer.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and family history, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform scrotal ultrasonography to confirm the diagnosis of an acute testicular condition.
