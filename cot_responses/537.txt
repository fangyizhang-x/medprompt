## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's consider the key points provided:

1. **Patient Profile**: A 35-year-old woman in her second pregnancy (gravida 2, para 1), which is considered a high-risk pregnancy due to multiple gestations and previous delivery complications.
2. **Symptoms**: Increased urinary frequency, which can be indicative of various conditions including diabetes mellitus.
3. **Vital Signs and Physical Examination**: Normal vital signs and a uterus consistent with a 16-week gestation on pelvic examination.
4. **Laboratory Studies**:
   - Non-fasting serum glucose concentration of 110 mg/dL: This is significantly above the normal range for pregnant women (typically <95 mg/dL) but within the normal range for non-pregnant individuals, indicating impaired glucose tolerance or pre-diabetes.
   - Urinalysis shows mild glucosuria: Glucosuria indicates the presence of glucose in the urine, which can be a sign of diabetes mellitus.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Decreased insulin production**: While decreased insulin production could lead to impaired glucose tolerance or pre-diabetes, it is not directly related to glucosuria (glucose in the urine).

B. **Increased glomerular filtration barrier permeability**: This would more likely result in proteinuria rather than glucosuria.

C. **Decreased insulin sensitivity**: Insulin resistance is a precursor to type 2 diabetes and can lead to impaired glucose tolerance or pre-diabetes, which matches the patient's laboratory findings (non-fasting serum glucose concentration of 110 mg/dL). Decreased insulin sensitivity would also explain mild glucosuria due to increased glucose in the urine.

D. **Increased glomerular filtration rate**: This choice is not directly related to the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance.

Considering these factors, the most likely explanation for this patient's glucosuria is decreased insulin sensitivity, which can lead to impaired glucose tolerance and subsequently result in mild glucosuria.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
