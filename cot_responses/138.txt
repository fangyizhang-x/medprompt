## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Travel history**: The patient recently traveled from Sydney to Los Angeles, which could expose him to various pathogens.
2. **Symptoms**: Pain and swelling in his left leg over the past few hours, with a 5 cm difference in circumference between the two legs.
3. **Medical history**:
   - Type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years
   - Smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years
4. **Vital signs**: Elevated temperature (36.9°C or 98.4°F), hypertension (140/90 mm Hg), and tachycardia (pulse is 90/min).
5. **Physical examination findings**:
   - The left leg appears more erythematous than the right with dilated superficial veins.
   - Venous duplex ultrasound shows non-compressibility.

Given these points, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **Impaired venous blood flow**: While impaired venous blood flow can cause swelling and pain in the affected limb due to increased pressure, it doesn't fully explain the difference in circumference between the two legs or the presence of dilated superficial veins.

B. **Impaired lymphatic blood flow**: Impaired lymphatic blood flow is more likely to cause edema (swelling) rather than erythema (redness). The patient's symptoms and examination findings don't strongly support this diagnosis.

C. **Subcutaneous soft-tissue infection that may extend to the deep fascia**: This option is highly plausible given the patient's recent travel history, which could expose him to various pathogens such as bacteria or viruses. The presence of erythema (redness) and dilated superficial veins also supports this diagnosis.

D. **Infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissues**: While infection can cause swelling and redness, it typically doesn't result in a significant difference in circumference between the two legs or the presence of non-compressibility on duplex ultrasound.

Considering these factors, the most likely explanation for the patient's illness is an infectious process that has spread to involve both venous and subcutaneous tissues. This would be consistent with option C, which describes a subcutaneous soft-tissue infection that may extend to the deep fascia.
