## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's consider the patient's symptoms: flushing, nausea, and palpitations after drinking a glass of wine with dinner. These symptoms are suggestive of a medication side effect.

The physician has replaced the medication with another one that interacts with the same target but at a different binding site. This is an example of pharmacokinetic drug interaction, where the new medication affects how the body metabolizes or excretes the original medication.

To determine the potential side-effect of the new medication, let's consider the options:

A. Hepatotoxicity - While some medications can cause liver damage, this is not a direct consequence of the patient's symptoms.
B. Lactic acidosis - This is a rare but serious side effect associated with certain medications, including those used to treat diabetes. However, it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.
C. Urinary tract infection (UTI) - UTIs are not typically associated with medication side effects or interactions.
D. Weight gain - This is a common side effect of many medications, including those used to treat diabetes.

Given that the new medication interacts with the same target but at a different binding site, it is likely to affect the metabolism or excretion of the original medication. One possible consequence of this interaction is weight gain, as the body may retain more of the original medication due to impaired elimination.

Therefore, the most likely side-effect of the new medication is weight gain.

The final answer is: D
