The clinical presentation of progressive dysphagia, fever, and white exudates on enlarged tonsils in a 7-year-old boy is highly suggestive of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). The presence of lymphocytes in the blood work and the positive results for TdT (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) and CALLA (CD10) are particularly indicative of this diagnosis.

TdT is an enzyme that is typically expressed by early lymphoid progenitor cells, while CALLA is a marker commonly used to identify B-cell lineage. The fact that both markers are positive suggests that the leukemia cells are of B-cell origin.

Given the presence of lymphoblasts (immature B-cells) in the peripheral blood smear and the high percentage of lymphocytes in the WBC count, it is likely that the leukemia cells are of B-cell lineage. This makes CD19 a highly likely marker to be positive as well.

CD5 is typically expressed on T-cells, particularly those of the T-lymphocyte lineage. While some T-cells can also express CD19, this is not a universal marker for B-cell lineage, and CD5 positivity alone would not be sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of ALL.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and immunophenotyping results, the most likely cell markers to be positive are CD19 and CALLA (CD10).
