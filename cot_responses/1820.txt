## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of painful red nodules on her legs, malaise, mild joint pains, and the recent development of these lesions over 3-4 days, along with a history of no preceding illness or trauma, the most likely diagnosis is Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF). The presence of tender lesions that have fused together and are now resembling bruises further supports this diagnosis.

The patient's elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 30 mm/h also supports the diagnosis of ARF. This elevated ESR indicates an inflammatory process, which is consistent with the symptoms and signs presented by the patient.

Given that the patient has no history of fever, trauma, or insect bites, and her complete blood count and ASO titers are within reference range, there is no indication of a bacterial infection such as streptococcal pharyngitis. Therefore, antibiotics would not be indicated at this time.

A chest X-ray may be useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected rheumatic heart disease or other conditions that could potentially lead to complications such as carditis, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the information provided.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with ARF, which requires prompt treatment to prevent long-term cardiac damage. The most appropriate initial management would be to start oral amoxicillin, an antibiotic commonly used in the treatment of streptococcal infections such as rheumatic fever.

Therefore, the answer is A. Oral amoxicillin.
