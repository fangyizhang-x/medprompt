(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and concerns, it appears that his anxiety about public speaking is exacerbating his sleep issues, which in turn are affecting his academic performance and relationship stability. The presence of a past medical history of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with fiber supplements also suggests that there may be an underlying gastrointestinal issue contributing to his anxiety.

The best initial step in management would be to address the patient's anxiety about public speaking, as it is likely a contributing factor to his sleep issues and overall well-being. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for performance anxiety is a well-established and effective treatment approach that can help the patient develop coping strategies and improve his confidence in presenting.

Option B, cognitive behavioral therapy, is the best initial step in management because:

- It addresses the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms: public speaking anxiety.
- It has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of performance anxiety.
- It is a non-pharmacological approach that can be tailored to the patient's specific needs and circumstances.

The other options are not as directly relevant to addressing the patient's primary concerns:

- Alprazolam (A) may provide temporary relief from anxiety but does not address the underlying causes of his symptoms.
- Fluoxetine (C) is an antidepressant that may help with sleep issues, but it is not a first-line treatment for performance anxiety or public speaking-related stress.
- Propranolol (D) is a beta-blocker that can help with anxiety, but it does not address the underlying causes of his symptoms and may have side effects that could impact his academic performance.

Therefore, the best initial step in management would be to initiate cognitive behavioral therapy for performance anxiety.
