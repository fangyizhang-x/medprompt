## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, the most likely diagnosis is epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), which is a type of ovarian neoplasm.

The key points to consider are:

1. The patient's symptoms have progressed over 6 months, indicating a possible malignancy.
2. The ultrasound reveals a large ovarian mass, which is consistent with EOC.
3. The CT scan shows no metastases, ruling out other potential causes for the symptoms.
4. The serum levels of CA-125 are elevated, which is often used as a tumor marker for ovarian cancer.
5. The biopsy confirms the primary neoplasm as ovarian in origin.

Considering these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. Intact basement membrane: This is more characteristic of benign epithelial tumors, such as choriocarcinoma or serous papillary carcinoma, rather than invasive ovarian cancer.

B. Loss of E-cadherin: This is a hallmark of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is associated with the progression and metastasis of many cancers, including ovarian cancer. In EOC, loss of E-cadherin expression is often observed, leading to increased cell motility and invasiveness.

C. Seeding via capillaries: This is more characteristic of serous papillary carcinoma, a subtype of ovarian cancer that typically presents with mucinous ascites and peritoneal dissemination rather than the large mass described in this case.

D. Increased proliferation of cells with preservation of size and shape: While increased cell proliferation can be seen in some cancers, it does not specifically indicate invasive carcinoma without metastasis.

Based on the analysis above, the most consistent cellular change with an invasive ovarian cancer diagnosis is loss of E-cadherin expression, which is associated with EMT and increased invasiveness.

The final answer is: B
