## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, we need to understand what we are asked to find: the annual mortality rate for ischemic stroke per 20,000 people in a town with a population of 20,000.

The study found that the 1-year case fatality rate for ischemic stroke was 20%. This means that out of every 100 people who had an ischemic stroke, 20 died within one year. To find the mortality rate per 100 people, we can divide this by 100:

20% / 100 = 0.2

This is equivalent to a 1-year case fatality rate of 20 deaths per 100 people.

To find the annual mortality rate for ischemic stroke per 20,000 people, we need to multiply the 1-year case fatality rate by the population size:

20 deaths / 100 people * 20,000 people = 400 deaths

Therefore, the estimated annual mortality rate for ischemic stroke per 20,000 people in this town is 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$
