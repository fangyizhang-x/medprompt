## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's understand the given information:

- The patient is a 22-year-old female with palpitations.
- Her vital signs show:
  - Pulse rate: 90/min (normal)
  - Respiratory rate: 28/min (slightly elevated)
  - Blood pressure: 136/86 mm Hg (within normal limits)
- ECG is normal
- The patient's current respiratory rate and PACO2 are given as 14/min and 36 mm Hg, respectively.

Given that the patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 28/min compared to her normal rate of 14/min, we can infer that she may be experiencing some degree of respiratory acidosis or hypercapnia. However, since the ECG is normal, it suggests that there are no obvious cardiac causes for her symptoms.

To calculate PACO2, we need to consider the relationship between respiratory rate and ventilation. The normal PaCO2 (alveolar carbon dioxide pressure) range is approximately 35-45 mm Hg at a normal respiratory rate of 12-20 breaths per minute. Since our patient's respiratory rate is higher than this average, her PACO2 will be higher.

The formula to calculate PACO2 from the given information can be derived as follows:

PACO2 = (Respiratory Rate x PaCO2) / Vital Capacity

However, since we don't have a direct measure of vital capacity or the patient's age, which affects lung volumes and capacities, we'll use an approximation based on the normal range.

Given that our patient's respiratory rate is 28/min, which is higher than the average (20 breaths per minute), we can estimate her PACO2 as follows:

PACO2 = (28 x 40 mm Hg) / 14 min
= 1120/14
â‰ˆ 80 mm Hg

However, this calculation does not take into account the patient's age and lung volumes. A more accurate approach would be to use a formula that accounts for these factors.

A commonly used approximation is:

PACO2 = (Respiratory Rate x PaCO2) / (Vital Capacity - Dead Space Volume)

Since we don't have direct information about vital capacity or dead space volume, let's assume an average value of 40 liters per minute for a 22-year-old female. This is a rough estimate
