## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of failure to lactate, intolerance to cold environments, fatigue, lightheadedness, and weight gain, along with her complicated delivery and postpartum blood loss, we can consider several potential underlying causes. However, the key information here is that she denies any personal or family history of thyroid disease.

Thyroid dysfunction can manifest in various ways, including changes in metabolism, fatigue, and cold intolerance. In the context of this patient's symptoms, particularly her inability to tolerate cold environments and failure to lactate, we should consider whether there might be an underlying issue related to her thyroid function.

The most relevant hormone levels that could be affected by thyroid dysfunction are those involved in regulating metabolism and energy balance. Among the options provided:

A. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) - While ADH is crucial for water balance, its primary regulation is through the kidneys, not directly related to cold intolerance or lactation.

B. Aldosterone - This hormone plays a key role in sodium and potassium balance, which can indirectly affect blood pressure and fluid balance. However, it's less directly linked to cold intolerance or lactation compared to other hormones.

C. Cortisol - As the primary stress hormone of the body, cortisol is involved in regulating metabolism, energy balance, and response to stress. It also has a role in lactation, as it helps regulate milk production. Given her failure to lactate, an issue with cortisol regulation could be a contributing factor.

D. Luteinizing hormone (LH) - LH is primarily involved in reproductive processes, particularly in the regulation of ovulation and menstruation. While important for overall endocrine function, its direct link to cold intolerance or lactation is less clear compared to other hormones.

Considering these points, cortisol levels are most likely to be affected by thyroid dysfunction, as thyroid issues can impact cortisol production. Therefore, a low level of cortisol (hypocortisolism) would be expected in this patient, making option C the most appropriate answer choice.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
