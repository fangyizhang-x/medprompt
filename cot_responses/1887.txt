Given the patient's history of schizophrenia and the current presentation of vision changes, we need to consider potential ocular manifestations that could be related to his psychiatric condition.

Firstly, it's essential to note that chlorpromazine is a typical antipsychotic medication known to have several side effects, including those on the retina. While retinitis pigmentosa (A) can cause visual disturbances, it typically presents with progressive vision loss and night blindness rather than sudden onset of changes over months.

Glaucoma (B) is less likely in this context because chlorpromazine is not commonly associated with glaucoma as a side effect. Glaucoma often requires more aggressive treatment to manage intraocular pressure.

Corneal deposits (D) can be seen in various conditions, including those that affect the retina or choroid. However, they are not typically associated with antipsychotic medication use.

Retinal hemorrhage (C), on the other hand, is a known side effect of chlorpromazine due to its association with retinal toxicity. Chlorpromazine can cause damage to the retina, leading to retinal hemorrhages, which may present as sudden changes in vision over months.

Therefore, considering the patient's history and the potential side effects of chlorpromazine, the most likely finding on ophthalmoscopy would be retinal hemorrhage (C).
