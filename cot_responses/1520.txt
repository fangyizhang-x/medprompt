## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history of breast cancer, particularly her mother's experience with chemotherapy and poor quality of life due to treatment side effects, it is essential to consider alternative treatments that minimize such adverse effects.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option in relation to the patient's condition:

A. Cell cycle arrest - This mechanism is typically associated with targeted therapies like PARP inhibitors for BRCA-mutated breast cancers, which does not seem relevant here given the estrogen- and progesterone receptor-positive status of the tumor.

B. Antagonist for estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus - While antagonists can be effective in certain contexts (e.g., aromatase inhibitors), this option doesn't directly address the patient's concern about chemotherapy side effects, which are more related to hormone therapy rather than direct action on estrogen receptors.

C. Inhibit peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogen - This mechanism is relevant for treatments that aim to block the conversion of androgens (like testosterone) into estrogens in peripheral tissues, such as the liver or peripheral adipose tissue. However, this option doesn't directly address the patient's concern about chemotherapy side effects.

D. Estrogen receptors downregulation in the breast - This is a key consideration for treatments that aim to minimize the adverse effects of hormone therapy on bone density and quality of life. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors can downregulate estrogen receptors in the breast, thereby reducing the risk of osteoporosis and other side effects associated with long-term hormone therapy.

Given the patient's history and concerns, the best treatment option appears to be an estrogen receptor modulator that downregulates estrogen receptors in the breast. This approach aligns with her desire to avoid chemotherapy and its potential side effects.

The final answer is: D
