To approach this question, let's consider the potential effects of Toxoplasma gondii infection on a fetus in utero.

1. **Understanding T. gondii**: This parasite is known to cause congenital toxoplasmosis when an infected mother becomes pregnant. The infection can lead to various complications for the fetus if it crosses the placenta.
   
2. **Potential Complications**:
   - **Deafness and Seizures (C)**: These are well-documented complications of congenital toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma gondii can cause damage to the developing brain, leading to hearing loss and seizures in affected fetuses.
   
   - **Petechial Rash (D)**: This is another common finding in neonates with congenital toxoplasmosis. The rash is typically small, red spots on the skin that may appear as a result of the parasite's effect on blood vessels.
   
   - **Hydrocephalus and Intracranial Calcifications (D)**: While these can be associated with congenital toxoplasmosis, they are not as commonly emphasized in the literature as deafness and seizures. However, hydrocephalus is a recognized complication that may result from chronic inflammation caused by the parasite.
   
   - **Hutchinsonâ€™s Teeth (B)**: This condition refers to the presence of small, peg-like projections on the upper front teeth. It is associated with congenital syphilis, not toxoplasmosis.

3. **Patent Ductus Arteriosus and Cataracts**: These are not typically listed as common complications of congenital toxoplasmosis in neonates.

Given this information, the correct answer involves identifying the options that are most commonly associated with congenital toxoplasmosis in neonates.

The final answer is:
## Answer
(C) Deafness, seizures, petechial rash
