## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Initial Assessment:
The patient is in active labor at 37 weeks' gestation with a history of complicated pregnancy and delivery due to GBS infection, which resulted in sepsis in the newborn. The current presentation includes contractions every 4 minutes, clear amniotic fluid pooling in the vagina, and a cephalic fetal presentation.

### Step 1: Assessing the Need for GBS Testing
Given that the patient has not been tested for group B streptococcal colonization before delivery and her previous pregnancy was complicated by an infection with GBS, it is essential to assess whether she is colonized or not. This information can guide the decision on whether to administer intrapartum antibiotics.

### Step 2: Evaluating the Options
- Option A (Vaginal-Rectal Swab for GBS Culture): This would be useful if there was a concern about colonization, but it does not address the need for nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) to confirm the presence of GBS.
- Option B (Administer Intrapartum Intravenous Penicillin): While this is an appropriate management strategy for suspected GBS infection, it does not directly address whether the patient is colonized or not.
- Option C (Vaginal-Rectal Swab for GBS Culture and NAAT): This option combines both culture and NAAT, which provides a more comprehensive assessment of GBS colonization status. It can help identify both colonized and non-colonized individuals, guiding antibiotic therapy accordingly.
- Option D (Vaginal-Rectal Swab for Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing): While this is the most direct method to confirm GBS colonization, it may not be practical or necessary given the availability of culture results.

### Step 3: Selecting the Most Appropriate Next Step
Given the need to assess both colonization status and guide antibiotic therapy, the most comprehensive approach would involve obtaining a swab for both culture and NAAT. This will provide critical information on whether the patient is colonized or not, allowing for targeted intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAPP) if necessary.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
