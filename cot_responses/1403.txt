Given the clinical presentation of this 5-year-old boy, we can deduce that he has a suspected fracture of the femoral head, specifically a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). This condition is characterized by a displacement of the growth plate in the upper part of the femur, leading to pain and limited mobility.

The key points from the history and physical examination that support this diagnosis include:

* The patient's fall from a ladder 3 weeks ago, which could have caused a fracture.
* The recent onset of left thigh pain, which is consistent with a slipped capital femoral epiphysis.
* Limited abduction and internal rotation on the affected side, indicating limited mobility in these movements.
* A mild left-sided antalgic gait, suggesting that the patient may be experiencing pain.

The laboratory findings, including an elevated leukocyte count (indicative of inflammation) and a slight decrease in hemoglobin concentration (which could be due to blood loss or marrow suppression), are also consistent with SCFE.

Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be to provide supportive care to manage symptoms and prevent complications. This includes:

* Limiting weight-bearing activities on the affected leg to reduce stress on the femoral head.
* Performing physical therapy to maintain range of motion and strength in the affected limb.
* Considering casting or bracing as a treatment option, although this is not typically recommended for SCFE due to the risk of further injury.

In contrast, oral hydroxyurea (A) may be considered for patients with SCFE who are at high risk of complications, such as those with a history of previous fractures or significant growth disturbances. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Femoral head pinning (C) and limited weight-bearing and physical therapy (D) are both potential treatment options for SCFE, but they may be considered after initial management has been initiated to prevent further injury.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to limit weight-bearing activities on the affected leg and perform physical therapy to maintain range of motion and strength.
