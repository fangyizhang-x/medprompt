## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history and current presentation, we can deduce that she has a significant risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to her family history of systolic hypertension in her mother and older brother, as well as her own blood pressure reading. The patient is also overweight with a BMI of 32 kg/m2, which increases her risk for CVD.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend that adults with a family history of hypertension or those who are overweight or obese should have their blood pressure checked at least once. Given the patient's age and lack of other risk factors, it is reasonable to consider her for an initial screening.

Option A, Abdominal ultrasound, may be relevant if there were concerns about polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or other gynecological conditions that could impact reproductive health. However, given the patient's presentation and family history, this is not a primary concern at this time.

Option B, Chest CT, is not indicated as a preventative test for this patient. While there may be underlying conditions that require further evaluation, such as lung cancer or cardiovascular disease, there are no specific indications for a chest CT in this scenario.

Option C, Fasting blood glucose, is not relevant to the patient's current presentation and risk factors. The patient takes oral contraceptives, which can help manage menstrual bleeding and reduce the risk of endometrial cancer, but they do not affect her fasting blood glucose levels.

Option D, Colonoscopy, may be relevant if there were concerns about colorectal cancer or other gastrointestinal conditions that could impact overall health. However, given the patient's age and lack of symptoms, this is not a primary concern at this time.

Therefore, based on the patient's risk factors and current presentation, the most appropriate preventative test indicated would be an abdominal ultrasound to check for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or other gynecological conditions that could impact reproductive health.
