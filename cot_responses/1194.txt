## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation and history, this patient's ingestion of termite poison is a concern for arsenic poisoning due to its similarity in symptoms to other toxic exposures.

1. **Identify the primary concern**: The patient has ingested an unknown amount of termite poison, which suggests arsenic exposure. Arsenic poisoning can cause gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting), neurological symptoms (numbness, tingling, weakness), and skin changes (dermatitis).

2. **Assess the options**:
   - A. N-acetylcysteine: This is used for acetaminophen overdose but not typically for arsenic poisoning.
   - B. Fomepizole: This is an antidote for methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning, not relevant to this scenario.
   - C. Deferoxamine: This is a chelating agent used for heavy metal poisoning (e.g., lead, mercury), which does not match the primary concern of arsenic exposure.
   - D. Dimercaprol: This is an antidote for arsenic and other heavy metals, making it the most appropriate choice.

3. **Reasoning**:
   - The patient's symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea) are consistent with gastrointestinal irritation due to arsenic poisoning.
   - The distinct garlic-like odor on the breath is a classic sign of arsenic exposure.
   - Arsenic poisoning can cause cardiac arrhythmias and prolongation of the QT interval, which aligns with the ECG findings.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the clinical presentation consistent with arsenic poisoning and the specific antidote for this condition, administering Dimercaprol is the most appropriate choice.

The final answer is: D
