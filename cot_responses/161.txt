Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most concerning symptom is his decreased pedal pulses bilaterally, which could indicate peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The absence of ankle jerk and patellar reflexes further supports this possibility. Additionally, the patient's mild dementia and decreased sensation to light touch, pinprick, and proprioception are also relevant.

The patient's history of hypertension, carotid stenosis, and smoking is concerning for cardiovascular disease. However, his current blood pressure reading (142/92 mmHg) is not significantly elevated compared to the 130-140 range typically considered normal in an elderly individual with a history of hypertension.

Considering these findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be to further evaluate the patient's neurological status and rule out any potential causes of his decreased sensation. This could involve ordering additional tests such as a lumbar puncture (LP) or a brain MRI to assess for any signs of stroke, multiple sclerosis, or other conditions that may cause sensory loss.

A lumbar puncture is particularly relevant given the patient's history of hypertension and carotid stenosis, which increases the risk of cerebral vasculature disease. The LP can help identify any abnormalities in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition or detect potential sources of bleeding or infection that may be contributing to his symptoms.

In contrast, no further workup required (A) is not appropriate given the patient's concerning neurological findings and history. Carbidopa-levodopa (B) is a medication used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, which does not directly relate to this patient's presentation. Prescribing thiamine supplementation (C) may be relevant for patients with dementia, but it does not address the current concern of decreased sensation.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a lumbar puncture to further evaluate the patient's neurological status and rule out any potential causes of his symptoms.
