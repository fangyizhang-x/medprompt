Given the patient's symptoms and ECG findings, the most likely diagnosis is a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The sudden onset of lightheadedness, palpitations, sweating, and tachycardia after being frightened by her neighborâ€™s dog are classic symptoms for SVT. The presence of an ECG showing a narrow QRS complex with a rapid ventricular rate further supports this diagnosis.

The preferred agent for pharmacologic management of SVT is adenosine. Adenosine works by transiently blocking AV node conduction, which can help terminate the tachycardia. It is particularly effective in patients who are hemodynamically stable and do not have contraindications to its use. In this case, the patient's blood pressure is normal (135/80 mm Hg), heart rate is within a relatively narrow range (150/min), and there are no signs of hemodynamic instability.

Adenosine has a rapid onset of action, typically within 2-3 minutes, making it an ideal choice for emergency situations like this. It is often used in conjunction with other medications to control the ventricular rate and prevent recurrence.

In contrast, verapamil (A) would be more suitable for treating atrial fibrillation or flutter, which are not indicated here. Metoprolol (B) is a beta-blocker that may be used to manage SVT, but it is not typically the first-line agent due to its slower onset of action and potential side effects. Propafenone (D) is also an anti-arrhythmic medication that can be used for SVT, but adenosine is generally considered more effective and safer in this context.

Therefore, the preferred agent for pharmacologic management of this condition is adenosine.
