(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of abdominal pain, nausea, and a history of family history of pancreatic cancer, this patient's symptoms are highly suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The presence of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain that is colicky, radiates to the tip of the right shoulder, and associated with nausea without vomiting points towards an inflammatory process affecting the pancreas.

The laboratory findings, including elevated serum amylase levels (AST 52 U/L, ALT 60 U/L), which are indicative of pancreatic enzyme elevation, further support this diagnosis. The normal liver function test results do not rule out acute pancreatitis as a cause for her symptoms.

Considering the severity and potential complications of acute pancreatitis, such as necrosis or severe infection, immediate surgical intervention is often recommended unless there are contraindications to surgery. However, given that this patient does not have any contraindications (e.g., severe abdominal tenderness, instability), emergency cholecystectomy (A) might be considered if the patient had gallstones as a potential cause for her pancreatitis.

Cholescintigraphy (B) is typically used to diagnose and assess the extent of pancreaticobiliary disease, such as gallstone disease or tumors. While it can provide useful information about the biliary system, it does not directly address the suspected acute pancreatitis in this case.

A CT scan (C) would be an excellent next step in management for several reasons: it is non-invasive, provides detailed images of the abdomen and pancreas, and can help identify complications such as necrosis or abscess formation. It is also a useful tool for assessing pancreatic function and identifying any potential causes of her symptoms.

Reassurance and close follow-up (D) might be appropriate if the patient's condition were to improve without intervention, but given the severity of her symptoms and laboratory findings, immediate action is required to address the suspected acute pancreatitis.

Therefore, considering the clinical presentation, laboratory results, and the need for a rapid assessment of pancreatic function and potential complications, the best next step in management would be to perform a CT scan (C).
