## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this patient, which includes a rash that started on the face and upper torso, oral lesions with painful erosions, vision problems (double vision and dry, itchy eyes), and fluid-filled vesicles/bullae, along with laboratory findings indicating an infection (elevated WBC count, CRP) and signs of inflammation (conjunctival injection, mild corneal abrasions), the most likely diagnosis is a condition known as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS).

The presence of oral lesions, particularly painful erosions, suggests mucosal involvement. The rash's distribution and the patient's symptoms further support this diagnosis. SJS is characterized by a distinct set of criteria that must be met to diagnose it, including the presence of two or more of the following: 

- A rash that covers more than 10% of the body surface area
- Oral lesions with mucosal involvement (e.g., painful erosions)
- Conjunctival injection
- Serositis (inflammation of the serous membranes surrounding the heart, lungs, liver, and spleen)

The laboratory findings also support this diagnosis. The elevated WBC count and CRP indicate an ongoing inflammatory process.

Given these criteria, the most appropriate diagnostic test to confirm the diagnosis would be a biopsy and histopathologic analysis of skin lesions (B). This is because SJS is characterized by specific changes in the skin, such as the presence of necrotic keratinocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils, which can be visualized through histopathological examination.

The other options are not as directly relevant to diagnosing SJS:

- Gram stain and culture of a skin sample (A) would be more appropriate for diagnosing bacterial infections.
- Direct immunofluorescence analysis of perilesional skin biopsy (C) is typically used to diagnose conditions such as dermatomyositis or lupus erythematosus, not SJS.
- Flow cytometry (D) may be useful in diagnosing certain hematological disorders but is not the most appropriate test for this patient's condition.

Therefore, the answer is B.
