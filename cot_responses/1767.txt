## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's sudden onset chest pain, hoarseness, and syncope (fainting), along with his history of hypertension and significant smoking history, it is essential to quickly assess for cardiac complications that could be precipitated by the chest pain. The presence of a syncopal episode followed by hypotension and tachycardia suggests a possible cardiac cause.

The patient's recent history of stopping his medication regimen for hypertension may indicate non-adherence, which can lead to uncontrolled blood pressure levels. This is particularly concerning given the patient's current presentation with severe chest pain radiating to the back, which could be indicative of aortic dissection or another serious cardiac condition.

Considering these factors, the most critical step in management would be to quickly evaluate for cardiac complications that could be causing his symptoms. Among the options provided:

- A Chest X-ray (A) might provide some information about the lungs and heart but is not the most immediate concern given the patient's acute presentation.
- B An EKG (B) can help identify arrhythmias or other cardiac abnormalities but may not directly address the potential cause of his chest pain.
- C Transthoracic echocardiography (C) is a non-invasive test that can quickly assess for cardiac structures and function, including the aorta. It is particularly useful in patients with symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease, such as chest pain radiating to the back or syncope.
- D Cardiac troponins (D) are used to diagnose myocardial infarction but may not be the immediate next step given the patient's acute presentation and potential for other causes.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a transthoracic echocardiogram to quickly assess for cardiac structures and function. This can help identify any potential causes of his chest pain and syncope, including aortic dissection or other serious cardiac conditions that could require immediate intervention.

## Answer Explanation:
The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with possible cardiac complications such as aortic dissection. The presence of severe chest pain radiating to the back, syncope, and hypotension in this context necessitates rapid evaluation for cardiac causes. Transthoracic echocardiography is the most appropriate next step in management due to its non-invasive nature, ability to quickly assess cardiac structures and function, and potential to identify life
