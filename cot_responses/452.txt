To answer this question, let's consider the properties and common side effects of vitamin A derivatives used in dermatology.

1. **Understanding Vitamin A Derivatives**: Vitamin A derivatives are commonly used to treat acne vulgaris due to their ability to reduce sebum production and inflammation. The most well-known derivative is retinoid.

2. **Common Side Effects of Retinoids**: While generally well-tolerated, retinoids can cause various side effects due to their mechanism of action on cell turnover and differentiation. Common side effects include:

   - **Alopecia (D)**: This is a known side effect of retinoids, particularly when used at high doses or for prolonged periods.
   
   - **Hypertrichosis (E)**: An increase in hair growth can occur due to the increased cell turnover and differentiation process stimulated by retinoids.

3. **Considering Other Options**:
   
   - **Hyperglycemia (A)**: While diabetes is a concern with certain medications, it's not typically associated directly with vitamin A derivatives.
   
   - **Hyperlipidemia (B)**: This condition involves high levels of lipids in the blood and can be influenced by various factors. However, it's not as commonly linked to retinoid therapy as other side effects.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the known side effects of retinoids, particularly their potential to cause alopecia, this is the major side-effect that would be most relevant for a 17-year-old male with acne vulgaris treated with a vitamin A derivative.

The final answer is: D
