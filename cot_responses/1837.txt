## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine which artery supplies the right half of the greater curvature of the stomach, we need to consider the anatomy of the stomach and its blood supply.

The right half of the greater curvature is primarily supplied by branches from the splenic artery. The splenic artery is a branch of the celiac trunk that runs down the left side of the abdomen and supplies blood to the spleen, pancreas, and stomach. It also gives off several branches that supply the lesser curvature of the stomach.

The short gastric arteries are actually branches of the splenic artery itself, not directly from it. They run along the greater curvature of the stomach and supply the fundus of the stomach.

The right gastroepiploic artery is a branch of the gastroduodenal artery, which in turn is a branch of the common hepatic artery. The gastroduodenal artery arises from the celiac trunk, but it does not directly supply the greater curvature of the stomach.

Therefore, considering the anatomy and blood supply to the region of the stomach being described (right half of the greater curvature), the most likely artery that provides this blood supply is the splenic artery.

The final answer is B.
