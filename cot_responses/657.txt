## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's age, nulliparity, and history of smoking, we can start by considering the potential causes of an irregularly enlarged uterus.

First, let's consider the options:

A. Leiomyoma: This is a common cause of uterine enlargement in women of reproductive age. It is characterized by the growth of smooth muscle cells that can lead to an enlarged uterus. Given the patient's nulliparity and history of smoking, leiomyomas are more likely than other causes.

B. Endometrial cancer: While endometrial cancer can cause uterine enlargement, it is less common in women under 40 years old. The patient's age makes this option less likely.

C. Endometrial hyperplasia: This condition involves the thickening of the lining of the uterus due to an overgrowth of cells. It can be caused by hormonal imbalances or genetic factors. However, it is not typically associated with a singular 4 cm hypoechoic mass inside the myometrial wall.

D. Uterine leiomyosarcoma: This is a rare type of cancer that originates in smooth muscle cells. While it can cause uterine enlargement, it is extremely rare and usually presents at an older age.

Considering these options, the most likely cause of the finding is A. Leiomyoma, as it is a common cause of uterine enlargement in women of reproductive age, particularly those with a history of smoking.

## Explanation
The patient's nulliparity and history of smoking increase her risk for leiomyomas, which are more commonly found in postmenopausal women or younger women who have never been pregnant. The irregularly enlarged uterus on the bimanual pelvic examination is consistent with this diagnosis. While other options can also cause uterine enlargement, they are less likely given the patient's age and smoking history.
