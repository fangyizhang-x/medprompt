## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 28-year-old woman who has undergone left renal transplantation for recurrent glomerulonephritis. This indicates that she has a history of kidney disease and may be at risk for various complications related to immunosuppressive therapy.

2. **Current Medications**: She is taking tacrolimus (an immunosuppressant) and azathioprine (another immunosuppressant). Both medications are commonly used in renal transplantation to prevent rejection.

3. **Side Effects of Immunosuppressive Therapy**: While both tacrolimus and azathioprine have various side effects, some are more concerning than others when it comes to long-term kidney function.

4. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - A. Gingival Hyperplasia: This is a known side effect of immunosuppressants like tacrolimus, but it's not directly related to kidney function.
   - B. Hepatic Necrosis: While liver toxicity can be a concern with certain medications, it's less commonly associated with the combination of tacrolimus and azathioprine compared to other options.
   - C. Kidney Injury: This is a critical consideration given the patient's history of glomerulonephritis and renal transplantation. Immunosuppressive therapy can increase the risk of kidney injury or exacerbate existing damage.
   - D. Polycythemia: This condition, characterized by an excess of red blood cells in the blood, is not typically associated with immunosuppressive therapy.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the patient's history and current medications, the most concerning adverse effect that needs to be monitored for is kidney injury. The combination of tacrolimus and azathioprine increases the risk of nephrotoxicity, which can lead to acute or chronic kidney damage.

The final answer is: C
