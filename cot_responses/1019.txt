## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a condition that affects the macula, leading to progressive visual impairment. The key points from the case are:

1. **Progressive difficulty reading**: This suggests a problem with central vision or fine detail.
2. **Avoids driving due to road sign difficulties**: This indicates significant impact on daily activities.
3. **Fundoscopic examination shows localized retinal elevation and drusen**: These findings are characteristic of certain conditions that affect the macula.
4. **A description of the patientâ€™s visual on the Amsler grid is shown**: The Amsler grid test is used to assess central vision, which is affected in this case.
5. **Fluorescein angiography shows early hyperfluorescence**: This finding indicates leakage from the choroid, a layer between the sclera and retina.

Considering these points:

- **Choroidal melanoma (A)**: While it can cause retinal elevation and drusen, it typically presents with more aggressive symptoms such as sudden vision loss or pain, which are not mentioned in this case.
- **Macular degeneration (B)**: This is a leading cause of vision loss in older adults, particularly affecting central vision. The fundoscopic examination findings, including localized retinal elevation and drusen, are consistent with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD can lead to early hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography due to leakage from the choroid.
- **Open-angle glaucoma (C)**: This condition typically presents with progressive vision loss in both eyes but is not associated with localized retinal elevation or drusen. It also does not typically cause central vision problems as described.
- **Retinal detachment (D)**: While it can cause sudden vision loss, the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest a retinal detachment.

Given the evidence, the most likely diagnosis is macular degeneration, particularly age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is characterized by localized retinal elevation and drusen on fundoscopic examination and early hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography.

Therefore, the answer is B.
