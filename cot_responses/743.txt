Given the patient's worsening condition, acute onset of nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate oral intake, fever (38.1°C or 100.6°F), tachycardia (92/min), and hypotension (132/85 mm Hg) with signs of dehydration (yellowish discoloration of her sclera and dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts on ultrasound), along with laboratory findings indicating severe pancreatitis (elevated lipase, leukocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes), the most critical step in management is to stabilize the patient's vital signs and address the acute abdomen.

Firstly, the patient's inability to tolerate oral intake necessitates immediate intravenous fluid resuscitation. This is crucial as it helps to maintain blood pressure, ensure adequate perfusion of vital organs, and prevent further complications such as shock or organ failure.

The initiation of antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and metronidazole is also essential for treating the patient's suspected infection, which could be related to her pancreatitis. However, given the acute presentation and signs of severe pancreatitis, starting antibiotics without addressing the underlying cause (e.g., bile duct obstruction) may not be sufficient.

Considering the ultrasound findings of dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder, which are indicative of a biliary obstruction, the most appropriate next step is to perform an abdominal CT scan. This imaging modality will help identify the cause of the patient's acute abdomen, including the extent of bile duct dilation, any pancreatic or periampullary involvement, and potential complications such as cholangitis.

A laparoscopic cholecystectomy (B) might be considered if there was a clear indication for gallbladder removal, but given the patient's severe pancreatitis and biliary obstruction, this is not the immediate next step. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (C) is not indicated in this scenario as it is used to treat kidney stones or other conditions unrelated to the patient's acute presentation.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (D) might be useful for diagnosing and treating certain pancreaticobiliary disorders, but given the patient's severe pancreatitis and biliary obstruction, it may not be the most appropriate next step in management at this point.
