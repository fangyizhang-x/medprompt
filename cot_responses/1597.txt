Given the patient's sudden-onset abdominal pain, history of unprotected sex, and physical exam findings, we can consider several potential diagnoses.

Firstly, the patient's symptoms started after a 2-hour history of sudden-onset abdominal pain, which suggests that the cause might be related to the abdomen rather than the testes. The fact that he was playing football before his symptoms also raises the possibility of a traumatic injury.

The patient's past medical history is notable only for asthma, but this does not directly relate to his current symptoms or physical exam findings.

Social history is also relevant, as unprotected sex with multiple partners increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, the fact that he has no other STI symptoms or signs makes this less likely.

The patient's temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respirations, and oxygen saturation are all within normal limits, which reduces the likelihood of an acute infectious process such as appendicitis.

Physical exam findings are also important. The non-tender abdomen with a right testicle elevated in a horizontal lie is suggestive of testicular torsion, which can cause sudden-onset pain and swelling of the affected testicle.

The fact that the scrotum is neither swollen nor discolored further supports this diagnosis, as testicular torsion typically causes pain and tenderness to the side of the affected testicle rather than the scrotum itself.

In contrast, appendicitis would likely present with more pronounced abdominal pain radiating to the lower right quadrant, fever, and possibly leukocytosis. Seminoma is a type of testicular cancer that can cause abdominal pain but typically presents with more systemic symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, or night sweats.

Traumatic urethral injury would likely present with more severe symptoms such as bleeding, pain to the perineum, and possibly hematuria (blood in the urine). The patient's history of unprotected sex does not directly suggest a urethral injury.

Therefore, based on the patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and risk factors, the most likely diagnosis is testicular torsion.
