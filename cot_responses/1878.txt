Given the patient's presentation, including her history of smoking, desire to quit, and physical exam findings, the most appropriate initial intervention would be a combination of weight loss, exercise, and nutrition consultation.

Firstly, considering her smoking habit, it is essential to address this as part of her overall health plan. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) such as nicotine gum or patches can help manage withdrawal symptoms and cravings associated with quitting smoking. Additionally, counseling sessions could be beneficial in motivating her to stick to the quit plan.

Secondly, addressing her weight is crucial given her BMI of 23 kg/m^2, which falls within the normal range. Weight loss can improve her overall health, reduce her risk of chronic diseases, and enhance her quality of life. A comprehensive approach that includes a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and possibly medication (if necessary) would be ideal.

Lastly, considering her family history of colon cancer, it is essential to discuss the importance of maintaining a healthy weight with her. Weight loss can also reduce her risk of developing other chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, which has been mentioned in her medical history.

In contrast, bupropion (A) is an antidepressant that may not be the most appropriate initial intervention for this patient, given her desire to quit smoking and lack of symptoms suggestive of depression. Colonoscopy (B) is a diagnostic procedure that would require further evaluation before initiating any treatment plan. Varenicline (C) is a prescription medication that can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms associated with nicotine cessation, but it may not address the underlying reasons for her desire to quit smoking.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial intervention for this patient would be weight loss, exercise, and nutrition consultation.
