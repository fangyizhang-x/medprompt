## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The scenario described is consistent with a case of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. The symptoms the infant is experiencing, such as irritability, poor feeding, stiffness, and apparent muscle spasms, are classic for this condition.

To prevent pertussis in infants, especially those born at home without medical care or access to vaccines, several interventions can be considered:

A. Conjugated polysaccharide vaccine given to infant at birth - This is the correct answer. The conjugated polyclonal vaccine (also known as the DTP vaccine) provides protection against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. It is recommended for infants born at home without medical care or access to vaccines.

B. Toxoid vaccine given to mother pre-natally - While toxoids are used in some countries to prevent diphtheria, they are not typically used as a primary prevention strategy for pertussis.

C. Improved maternal nutrition - Maternal nutrition is important for the health of the infant, but it does not provide direct protection against pertussis.

D. Genetic counseling - This option is unrelated to preventing pertussis in infants and is more relevant to genetic disorders or conditions that affect an individual's ability to carry a pregnancy to term.

Therefore, the most appropriate intervention listed to prevent this disease is the administration of conjugated polysaccharide vaccine to the infant at birth.
