## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, including difficulty sleeping, reduced sleep duration, early morning wake-up, and increased time to fall asleep, it is likely that she has insomnia. The presence of a mildly anxious mood and a full range of affect further supports this diagnosis.

The patient's sleep patterns are also consistent with insomnia, as evidenced by the gradual decrease in sleep duration over 2 years and the need for more time to fall asleep.

Considering her age (74) and physical characteristics (BMI of 21), it is less likely that she has a primary sleep disorder such as sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome. The absence of snoring, smoking, or alcohol consumption also reduces the likelihood of these conditions.

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination results, the most appropriate next step in management would be to reassurance. This approach acknowledges the patient's current situation and provides emotional support, while also encouraging her to continue with her usual sleep hygiene practices (e.g., avoiding caffeine before bedtime, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule). Reassurance may help alleviate some of the anxiety related to her insomnia symptoms.

The other options are not appropriate next steps in management:

A. Sleep restriction is typically recommended for patients with primary sleep disorders such as insomnia or sleep apnea, but it is not indicated in this case given the patient's age and physical characteristics.

B. Flurazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be used to treat insomnia, but it may have side effects and should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

D. Paradoxical intention (also known as sleep restriction therapy) involves restricting the amount of time spent in bed each night, which may not be necessary or effective for this patient given her age and physical characteristics.
