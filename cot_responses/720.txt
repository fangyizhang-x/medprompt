## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, let's break down the key points:

1. **High beta-hCG**: This is an early marker for potential chromosomal abnormalities, particularly Down syndrome.
2. **Low PAPP-A**: This is another marker that can be associated with an increased risk of Down syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities.
3. **Previous history of spontaneous abortions in the first trimester**: This raises concerns about recurrent miscarriage, which may be related to chromosomal abnormalities.

Considering these points, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an ultrasound examination with nuchal translucency (NT) and crown-rump length (CRL) measurement. Here's why:

- **Nuchal Translucency (NT)**: This is a marker that measures the thickness of the fluid-filled space at the back of the fetus's neck. An increased NT can be associated with an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome.
- **Crown-Rump Length (CRL) Measurement**: This measures the length of the fetus from the top of its head to its buttocks. A short CRL is a marker for potential chromosomal abnormalities.

The other options are not as directly relevant to this patient's presentation:

- **Rubella Virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Toxoplasma IgG Testing**: While these tests can be useful in certain contexts, they are not the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and previous history.
- **Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) with Cell Culturing and Karyotyping**: CVS is typically performed between 10-12 weeks of pregnancy. Given that this patient is at week 11, it would be too early for a CVS.
- **Quadruple Test at the 15th Week of Pregnancy**: This test involves screening for four different conditions: Down syndrome, neural tube defects, hemoglobinopathies, and other chromosomal abnormalities. While it can provide valuable information, it is not as specific or sensitive as an ultrasound examination with NT and CRL measurement.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in managing this patient would be to perform an ultrasound examination with nuchal translucency and crown-rump length measurement.
