## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's consider the key elements presented:

1. **Disseminated zoster infection**: This is an opportunistic infection that can affect individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS.
2. **Treatment with IV acyclovir**: Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat herpes simplex virus infections, including zoster.
3. **Worsening course of illness on the 4th day after admission**: This suggests that the patient's condition may have deteriorated despite treatment.
4. **Creatinine level increases to 4.2 mg/dL**: Elevated creatinine levels indicate a decline in kidney function.
5. **Birefringent needle-shaped crystals in urinalysis**: These crystals are characteristic of uric acid nephropathy, which can be caused by hyperuricemia (elevated uric acid levels).

Given these points, the question asks what could have prevented this deterioration in the patient's renal function.

- **A. Initial administration of glucocorticoids**: While glucocorticoids are used to treat various conditions, including some infections and inflammatory diseases, there is no direct link between their initial administration and preventing the worsening of kidney function in this context.
  
- **B. Obtaining a thorough history of patient allergies**: Allergic reactions can cause renal issues, but there's no indication that the patient had an allergic reaction to acyclovir or any other medication.

- **C. Adequate initial hydration**: Hydration is crucial for maintaining kidney function. However, in this scenario, the patient has already been treated with IV acyclovir and has developed hyperuricemia (elevated uric acid levels), which can lead to renal impairment.

- **D. Initial administration of allopurinol**: Allopurinol is a medication used to treat gout by reducing uric acid production in the body. It can also be used to prevent or treat hyperuricemia, especially in patients with diabetes or kidney disease. Given that the patient has disseminated zoster and developed hyperuricemia, initiating allopurinol could have prevented the worsening of renal function by addressing the underlying cause.

Therefore, considering the patient's condition and the potential effects of each option on kidney function, the most logical choice to prevent the deterioration in the patient's renal function is:
