## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's consider the key points provided:

1. **Patient Profile**: A 28-year-old woman in her first pregnancy at 10 weeks gestation.
2. **Symptoms and Examination Findings**: She feels well, has no history of serious illness, and examination is normal.
3. **Ultrasonography Results**: The pregnancy appears to be consistent with a 10-week gestation.

Given these points, we can infer that the patient's thyroid function is likely within the normal range for her age and gestational age. Here's why:

- **Thyroid-binding globulin (TBG)**: TBG levels increase with gestation due to increased production of thyroxine-binding globulin by the placenta. However, this increase typically occurs after 12 weeks of gestation.
- **Free Triiodothyronine (T3) and Free Thyroxine (T4)**: These hormones are produced by the thyroid gland and their levels can be affected by various factors including maternal thyroid function during pregnancy. In general, T3 and T4 levels tend to decrease slightly in early pregnancy due to increased conversion of T4 to T3.
- **Total T3+T4**: This value is often used as a marker for thyroid function. It's generally considered normal or near-normal throughout pregnancy.

Considering these points:

- Option A (↑ normal, ↑ normal, ↓) is incorrect because the patient's TBG levels would likely be increased due to placental production.
- Option B (↓ normal, normal, ↓) is also incorrect as T3 and T4 levels typically decrease in early pregnancy.
- Option C (Normal, normal, normal) aligns with our understanding of thyroid function changes during pregnancy. TBG increases, T3 and T4 levels decrease slightly due to conversion, and the total T3+T4 remains near-normal.
- Option D (↓ ↓, normal, ↓) is incorrect because it suggests a significant drop in both T3 and T4 levels, which would be unusual for early pregnancy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
