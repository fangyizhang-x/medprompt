The baby's symptoms, such as tachypnea, subcostal and intercostal retractions, nasal flaring, and cyanosis, are indicative of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). RDS is a common condition in preterm infants due to the immaturity of their lungs.

Given that the baby was born after the 32nd gestational week by cesarean delivery, it suggests that the baby's lungs were not mature enough to function properly. The presence of nasal flaring and subcostal retractions further supports this diagnosis.

The fact that the cyanosis is responding well to initial administration of oxygen also points towards RDS. Oxygen therapy can help improve oxygenation in preterm infants with RDS.

Considering the mother's history of gestational diabetes, it is possible that she may have had some degree of fetal macrosomia (excessive birth weight), which could have contributed to the baby's prematurity and lung immaturity. However, this is not a direct cause of RDS in this case.

The nasogastric tube was positioned without problems, which suggests that there were no immediate issues with the airway or digestive tract.

In contrast, options B (Tracheoesophageal fistula) and C (Pneumonia) are less likely diagnoses for this presentation. Tracheoesophageal fistula would typically present with more severe respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing and stridor, which are not mentioned in the case. Pneumonia would also require more pronounced signs of infection, such as fever and increased white blood cell count.

Option D (Congenital heart anomaly with right-to-left shunt) is a possible diagnosis for this presentation, but it is less likely given the absence of other symptoms or signs that might suggest a congenital heart defect. A right-to-left shunt would typically present with more severe respiratory distress and cyanosis, as well as other cardiac abnormalities.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS).
