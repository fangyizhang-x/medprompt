(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is an intestinal obstruction or a condition causing vomiting after feeding, which could be related to a gastrointestinal issue such as Hirschsprung's disease.

The best next step in management would be to investigate the cause of the vomiting and abdominal distension. 

- Option A (Abdominal ultrasound) is the best choice because it can help identify any obstructions or abnormalities in the intestines, which could explain the patient's symptoms.
- Option B (Abdominal radiograph) may show some signs of obstruction but would not provide as much detail as an ultrasound and might not detect smaller obstructions.
- Option C (Trial of cow's milk-free diet) is a reasonable step to consider if there are concerns about the patient's diet, but it does not address the underlying cause of the symptoms.
- Option D (Trial of empiric proton pump inhibitor) may be considered for acid-related issues, but it does not directly address the suspected intestinal obstruction or condition causing the vomiting.

Therefore, the best next step in management is to perform an abdominal ultrasound to investigate the patient's abdominal contents and detect any abnormalities that could explain his symptoms.
