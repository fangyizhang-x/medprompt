## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, which include intermittent swelling of his left arm and feeling of fullness in his head that is exacerbated by lying down and bending over to tie his shoes, along with physical examination findings of left-sided facial edema and distention of superficial veins in the neck and left chest wall, we can approach this question systematically.

Firstly, let's consider the symptoms' timing. The patient has been experiencing these symptoms for 3 weeks, which suggests a chronic condition rather than an acute event.

A. Right heart failure - While right heart failure can cause edema and swelling in the arms, it typically presents with more pronounced symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and peripheral edema that is not limited to the left arm or neck.

B. Cervical rib - A cervical rib is a congenital anomaly where there is an extra rib above the first rib. It can cause shoulder pain and sometimes lead to thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), which may present with symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or weakness in the arm on the same side as the rib. However, TOS typically causes more localized pain and discomfort rather than fullness in the head.

C. Apical lung tumor - Lung tumors can cause pleural effusion, which is fluid accumulation in the space between the lungs and chest wall. This condition can lead to swelling of the neck and chest wall due to the accumulation of fluid. Given the patient's symptoms of intermittent swelling of his left arm and feeling of fullness in his head that are exacerbated by lying down or bending over, this option seems highly plausible.

D. Subclavian steal syndrome - This is a condition where there is a reversal of blood flow through the subclavian artery due to compression or stenosis at the origin of the artery. It can cause symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting spells but typically does not present with fullness in the head.

Considering these options, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is an apical lung tumor, which can lead to pleural effusion causing swelling of the neck and chest wall, and subsequently, symptoms such as intermittent arm swelling and feeling of fullness in the head that are exacerbated by certain positions.

The final answer is: C
