## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, including sharp right-sided chest pain that worsens on inspiration and coughing, worsening shortness of breath, and a history of alcohol intoxication, we can deduce several key points:

1. **Alcohol-related injury**: The patient was admitted after passing out from alcohol intoxication, which suggests potential hypoxia or other complications related to his intoxication.
2. **Cardiovascular disease**: The patient has coronary artery disease and hypertension, both of which increase the risk for cardiovascular events.
3. **Smoking history**: Smoking is a significant risk factor for respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer.

Considering these factors, we can now address the question about the pleural fluid examination:

- **Amylase level**: While amylase levels are typically elevated in conditions like pancreatitis or aspiration of pancreatic enzymes, there's no direct indication that this patient has a pancreatitis-like condition. Therefore, option A is unlikely.
  
- **Lymphocytosis**: Lymphocytosis (an increase in lymphocytes) can be seen in various conditions, including infections and inflammatory diseases. However, the context provided doesn't strongly suggest an infectious or inflammatory process that would typically cause lymphocytosis.

- **Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio**: This is a key finding in pleural effusions. A low ratio (less than 0.5) suggests that there's less protein and more hemoglobin in the pleural fluid compared to serum, which can be seen in conditions like pulmonary edema or fibrosis rather than malignancy.

- **Glucose level**: The glucose level in pleural fluid is typically not significantly elevated due to the lung's low metabolic rate. Therefore, option D is unlikely.

Given these considerations, the most likely finding in this patient's pleural fluid examination would be a **low pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio**, indicating that there's less protein and more hemoglobin in the pleural fluid compared to serum, which is consistent with conditions like pulmonary edema or fibrosis.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
