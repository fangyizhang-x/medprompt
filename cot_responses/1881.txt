Given the patient's presentation with photophobia, blurred vision, conjunctival injection, and slit-lamp examination showing evidence of inflammation in the anterior chamber, it is reasonable to consider an exacerbation of Crohn’s disease. The presence of inflammation in the anterior chamber suggests uveitis, a common complication of Crohn’s disease.

The patient's current medication regimen includes mesalazine (a first-line treatment for Crohn’s disease), azathioprine (an immunosuppressive agent that can be used to treat active Crohn’s disease), and prednisone (a corticosteroid that is often used as a rescue medication in cases of flare-ups). However, the addition of infliximab (a biologic medication) would not be appropriate at this time due to the risk of exacerbating uveitis.

Discontinuing sulfasalazine (option B) might be considered if the patient's symptoms were more severe or if there was evidence of a significant flare-up. However, given that this is a new onset of symptoms and the patient has no abdominal pain or diarrhea, it is unlikely that sulfasalazine would be the best choice.

Increasing the dose of prednisone (option C) might provide temporary relief but could potentially worsen the situation if the inflammation is not adequately controlled. The current dose may be sufficient to manage the patient's symptoms, and increasing the dose could lead to side effects such as weight gain, mood changes, and increased risk of infections.

Therefore, the most appropriate modification to this patient’s medication at this time would be to continue her current regimen without adding any new medications that could potentially exacerbate uveitis.
