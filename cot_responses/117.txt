## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given that the physician can only grade, but no stage, the neoplasm, we need to consider what information is typically available for grading and staging in breast cancer.

For grading, the most commonly used system is the Nottingham Histological Index (NHI), which assesses the size, shape, and density of the tumor cells. The NHI grades the tumor as follows:

- Grade 1: Well-differentiated tumor with minimal nuclear atypia
- Grade 2: Moderately differentiated tumor with some nuclear atypia
- Grade 3: Poorly differentiated tumor with marked nuclear atypia

The NHI is a useful tool for predicting prognosis and guiding treatment decisions.

For staging, the most commonly used system is the TNM classification, which takes into account the size of the tumor (T), the extent of lymph node involvement (N), and whether the cancer has spread to distant sites (M). The TNM system includes:

- Tumor size: The size of the tumor in centimeters
- Nodal status: Whether the cancer has spread to axillary lymph nodes
- Metastasis: Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body

Given that the physician can only grade, but no stage, the neoplasm, we can conclude that:

A. The tumor cells exhibit marked nuclear atypia.

This is because the NHI grading system assesses the size and shape of the tumor cells, which would be relevant for determining the grade (NHI) rather than staging (TNM).

B. The tumor has metastasized to the axillary lymph nodes.

This information is not available as the physician can only grade, but no stage, the neoplasm.

C. The tumor has not metastasized to the contralateral superior mediastinal lymph nodes.

This information is also not available as the physician can only grade, but no stage, the neoplasm.

D. The tumor has spread via blood-borne metastasis.

This information is not relevant for determining prognosis or staging in this case, as the question specifically mentions that the tumor has been present for 4 months and there are no signs of distant metastasis (e.g., lymphadenopathy).
