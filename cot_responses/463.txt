(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, let's break down the key points:

1. **Location and Nature of Pain**: The patient experiences excruciating, stabbing pain around the left side of his head. This type of pain is characteristic of cluster headaches.
2. **Duration and Timing**: The pain lasts for 60 minutes every morning, which is consistent with cluster headaches that typically occur in clusters or cycles throughout the day.
3. **Associated Symptoms**: There are no aura symptoms (e.g., visual disturbances, sensory changes), nausea, vomiting, or other systemic complaints mentioned.
4. **Past Medical History**: The patient has no past medical history to suggest a different diagnosis.

Considering these points:

- **Cluster Headaches (A)**: While cluster headaches do involve severe pain around the eye, they are typically not associated with tearing of the eye and usually occur in clusters or cycles throughout the day.
- **Chronic Paroxysmal Hemicrania (CPH) (B)**: CPH is characterized by frequent, unilateral headaches that can be severe but does not typically involve the same pattern of pain as cluster headaches.
- **Short-Lasting Unilateral Neuralgiform Headaches with Conjunctival Injection and Tearing (SUNCT) Syndrome (C)**: SUNCT syndrome involves intense, stabbing pain on one side of the head, but it is often accompanied by conjunctival injection, lacrimation, and sometimes photophobia. The duration of the headache episodes can be shorter than 60 minutes.
- **Trigeminal Neuralgia (D)**: Trigeminal neuralgia typically involves sharp, stabbing pain in one side of the face, but it is usually not associated with tearing or conjunctival injection.

Given these considerations, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is cluster headaches due to their characteristic location, duration, and absence of other symptoms that might suggest a different condition.
