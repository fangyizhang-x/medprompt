## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, including difficulty swallowing due to dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes (xerophthalmia), along with enlarged lymph nodes in both eyes, we can infer that she likely has Sjögren's syndrome. This autoimmune disorder is characterized by its effects on exocrine glands, particularly the salivary and lacrimal glands.

The presence of dry mouth and dry eyes suggests an issue with mucous gland function or ductal obstruction. The enlargement of lymph nodes in both eyes further supports this diagnosis, as it indicates a systemic inflammatory response.

In Sjögren's syndrome, the pattern of reactive lymphadenitis is typically characterized by diffuse hyperplasia. This means that there is an increase in the number of immune cells (lymphocytes) within the affected lymph nodes, leading to their enlargement and hyperplastic changes.

The other options are less likely:

- Follicular hyperplasia refers to an increase in the number of follicles in the lymphoid tissue, which is not characteristic of Sjögren's syndrome.
- Paracortical hyperplasia involves an increase in the number of immune cells (T-cells) within the lymph nodes, but it is more commonly associated with other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or chronic infections.
- Mixed B and T cell hyperplasia might be seen in some cases of Sjögren's syndrome, but diffuse hyperplasia is a more typical finding.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the pattern of reactive lymphadenitis typically associated with Sjögren's syndrome, the correct answer is:

## Answer
(C. Diffuse hyperplasia)
