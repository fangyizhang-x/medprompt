## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's presentation is suggestive of a lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injury, specifically the medial aspect of the knee.

1. The patient reports a direct blow to his right knee from another player during a basketball game, which is consistent with a valgus stress test positive result.
2. The lack of swelling or effusion in both knees suggests that there is no significant intra-articular hemorrhage or joint effusion, which would be more typical of a meniscal injury.
3. The patient's right knee has no laxity upon varus stress test, but is more lax upon valgus stress test when compared to his left knee. This finding is consistent with LCL injuries, as the LCL is responsible for stabilizing the medial aspect of the knee joint during valgus loading.
4. The absence of laxity on both tests and firm endpoints without laxity in all tests (Lachman's test and posterior drawer test) further supports an LCL injury.

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and lateral collateral ligament (LCL) are all structures that could be injured in this scenario, but the combination of findings points more strongly towards an LCL injury. The ACL is less likely to be injured in a direct blow to the knee from another player, whereas the PCL is more commonly associated with high-impact trauma such as falls from heights or direct blows to the knee.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely structure injured is the medial collateral ligament.
