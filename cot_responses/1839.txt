Given the patient's symptoms and history, it is essential to consider the potential causes of her condition, which includes a possible allergic or inflammatory etiology given the erythema, papules, and telangiectasias. The fact that she has tried various sunscreens without relief suggests an issue with her skin's response to sunlight.

The patient's stress levels could be contributing to her symptoms, as stress is known to exacerbate conditions like acne vulgaris and rosacea. However, the presence of erythema on the nose, chin, and medial cheeks, along with scant papules and telangiectasias, suggests a more systemic issue rather than just localized acne.

Considering these factors, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. Topical corticosteroids: While topical corticosteroids can be effective for mild to moderate rosacea, they may not address the underlying cause of this patient's symptoms and could potentially worsen her condition if used excessively or without proper medical supervision.

B. Topical benzoyl peroxide: Benzoyl peroxide is commonly used in the treatment of acne vulgaris but might not be sufficient for addressing the erythema and papules seen in this patient.

C. Oral isotretinoin: Isotretinoin is a powerful oral retinoid that is typically reserved for severe, resistant, or life-threatening cases of rosacea. Given the patient's age (40) and the severity of her symptoms, oral isotretinoin might be considered an option, but it carries significant risks, including birth defects if used during pregnancy.

D. Topical metronidazole: Metronidazole is an antibiotic that can be effective against mild to moderate acne vulgaris and rosacea. It may also have anti-inflammatory properties, which could help with the erythema and papules seen in this patient.

Given the potential benefits of topical metronidazole for addressing the erythema and papules without the significant risks associated with oral isotretinoin, it appears to be the most appropriate initial treatment option for this patient. However, it is essential to note that further evaluation and possibly a prescription-strength formulation may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and optimize treatment.

Therefore, the answer is D.
