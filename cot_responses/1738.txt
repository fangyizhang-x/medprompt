Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, let's break down the key points to determine the most appropriate next step in management:

1. **Progressive burning pain and intermittent "electrical shocks"**: These symptoms are suggestive of neuropathy, which can be caused by various conditions including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, or nerve damage.

2. **History of rash around right nipple and axilla 3 months ago**: This could indicate a post-streptococcal skin infection (PSSI), also known as erythema marginatum in children, but given the patient's age and symptoms, it is more likely to be related to an autoimmune condition such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis.

3. **Myocardial infarction 2 years ago**: This increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, which could contribute to neuropathy due to atherosclerosis.

4. **Smoking history**: Smoking is a significant risk factor for many conditions, including cardiovascular disease and peripheral neuropathy.

5. **Current medications**: Aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol, and ramipril are all used to manage cardiovascular and hypertension but do not directly address the patient's current symptoms of neuropathy or skin rash.

6. **Physical examination findings**: Increased sensation to light touch over the right chest could indicate a dermatomal distribution of pain, which is consistent with a nerve root compression syndrome such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).

Considering these points, the most appropriate next step in management would be to try to alleviate the patient's neuropathic symptoms and address his skin rash. 

- **Sublingual nitrates** are used to treat angina pectoris by causing vasodilation, which can help relieve chest pain. However, they do not directly address the underlying cause of the neuropathy or the dermatomyositis/rash.

- **Oral tricyclic antidepressants (OTCAs)** may be beneficial for managing neuropathic pain but are generally reserved for patients who have failed other treatments due to their side effect profile and potential for worsening cardiovascular disease.

- **Oral famciclovir** is an antiviral medication used to treat herpes zoster (shingles) and varicella-zoster virus infections. While the patient's rash could be related to a post-streptococcal infection, there is no indication that he has
