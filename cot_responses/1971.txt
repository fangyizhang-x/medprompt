## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's analyze the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings:

1. The patient presents with fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, pooling of oral secretions, inspiratory stridor, thickening of the epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds on lateral x-ray, and a positive throat culture for small, gram-negative coccobacilli.
2. These findings are suggestive of diphtheria, a bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae.

Given this diagnosis, the primary mechanism of action of the recommended antibiotic for chemoprophylaxis is crucial to determine.

A. Inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA-polymerase - This is the mechanism of action for tetracyclines and doxycycline, which are not typically used for diphtheria prophylaxis.
B. Inhibition of the 50S ribosomal subunit - This is the mechanism of action for macrolides (e.g., erythromycin), which are effective against Corynebacterium diphtheriae but are not usually recommended as chemoprophylaxis due to potential side effects and resistance.
C. Inhibition of prokaryotic topoisomerase II - This is the mechanism of action for streptomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic that is effective against gram-negative bacteria but is not typically used for diphtheria prophylaxis.
D. Inhibition of the 30S ribosomal subunit - This is the mechanism of action for erythromycin and other macrolides, which are commonly recommended as chemoprophylaxis for individuals who have been exposed to Corynebacterium diphtheriae.

Therefore, the primary mechanism of action of the drug that should be started on the recommended antibiotic for chemoprophylaxis is inhibition of the 30S ribosomal subunit.
