## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine which defense mechanism the patient is exhibiting, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Denial**: The patient denies any recent injuries despite being seen for a sports physical. This suggests that he might be avoiding acknowledging or confronting uncomfortable truths about his health.

2. **Displacement**: There is no clear indication of displacement in this scenario. Displacement typically involves redirecting emotions from one source to another, often as a coping mechanism. The patient's reaction doesn't seem to involve diverting attention away from any perceived issues.

3. **Repression**: Repression refers to the process of pushing uncomfortable thoughts or memories into the unconscious mind, making them inaccessible and unresponsive to conscious awareness. This defense mechanism is more commonly associated with psychological distress rather than a straightforward avoidance of physical health concerns.

4. **Suppression**: Suppression involves deliberately avoiding thinking about or remembering something that is unpleasant or difficult to confront. Given the patient's recent history of a serious injury (fracturing his collar bone) and his emotional response to discussing it, suppressing this information could be seen as an attempt to avoid confronting the reality of his vulnerability.

5. **Hypothetical scenario**: The mention of the patient's mother dying of ovarian cancer 6 months ago is crucial in understanding his behavior. Given that he has a family history of hypertension and is expressing excitement about baseball tryouts, it seems plausible that he might be using this as an emotional coping mechanism to deal with stress related to his health concerns.

Considering these points, the patient's behavior aligns most closely with **D. Suppression**, as he appears to be deliberately avoiding discussing or confronting his recent injury due to potential discomfort or anxiety about how others might perceive him or his vulnerability.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
