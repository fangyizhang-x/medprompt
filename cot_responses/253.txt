## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, let's break down the key points:

1. **Painless swelling of the neck**: This symptom can be associated with several conditions, including lymphadenopathy or lymphoma.
2. **Severe night sweats and unintentional weight loss**: These symptoms are indicative of a systemic illness that may involve the hematological system (e.g., anemia, infection).
3. **History of long-standing hypertension and kidney transplant**: This history is relevant for considering potential complications related to immunosuppressive therapy.
4. **Positive family history of lymphoma**: This increases the likelihood of a genetic predisposition to lymphoproliferative disorders.

Considering these points:

- **Drug-induced lymphadenopathy (A)**: While possible, this diagnosis does not fully account for the patient's systemic symptoms (night sweats and weight loss) or the specific findings on physical examination.
- **Cytomegalovirus infection (B)**: This is a common cause of lymphadenopathy in immunocompromised patients but typically presents with more pronounced systemic symptoms, such as fever, and would not be the primary diagnosis given the patient's presentation.
- **Multiple myeloma (C)**: Although possible, this diagnosis does not fully explain the patient's specific findings, particularly the lack of anemia or other bone marrow abnormalities on laboratory studies.
- **Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) (D)**: This is a highly likely diagnosis given the combination of symptoms and physical examination findings. NHL can present with painless neck swelling, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, and splenomegaly (as seen in this patient). The laboratory studies also support an NHL diagnosis, as they show lymphocytosis (elevated leukocyte count) without other abnormalities.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), given the comprehensive evaluation of the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.
