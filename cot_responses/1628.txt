Given the patient's significant smoking history and family history of lung cancer, it is essential to consider preventive measures to reduce his risk of developing lung cancer.

Firstly, the patient's serum potassium level is slightly low (3.9 mEq/L), which could be a concern for patients with a history of smoking or other conditions that affect electrolyte balance. However, in this case, the potassium level does not seem significantly abnormal compared to the rest of the laboratory findings.

The patient's serum sodium and chloride levels are within normal limits, and his serum calcium, phosphate, hemoglobin, bicarbonate, bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin levels are all within normal ranges. These results suggest that there is no acute or chronic infection, inflammation, or other conditions that could be causing these laboratory abnormalities.

Considering the patient's significant smoking history (35-pack-year), his family history of lung cancer, and the fact that he has quit 5 years ago, it is crucial to recommend a preventive screening test to reduce his risk of developing lung cancer. The American Cancer Society recommends that adults with a history of heavy smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke should undergo low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) of the chest every 2 years starting at age 50.

Option C, Low-dose CT scan (LDCT) of the chest, is the recommended preventive screening test for this patient. The LDCT can help identify lung cancer in early stages when it is more treatable, and it can also detect other conditions that may be causing symptoms or abnormalities in the lungs.

The other options are not as relevant to this patient's situation:

- Option A, Chest X-ray, may be useful for detecting lung nodules or masses, but it does not provide information about the patient's overall lung health or risk of developing lung cancer.
- Option B, ECG, is a screening test for cardiovascular disease and is not directly related to the patient's lung health.
- Option D, No screening indicated, is incorrect because the patient's significant smoking history and family history of lung cancer make it clear that he should undergo preventive screening.

Therefore, the recommended preventative screening test for this patient at this time is a Low-dose CT scan (LDCT) of the chest.
