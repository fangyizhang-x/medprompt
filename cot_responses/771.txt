## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine which technique is most appropriate for attempting to prove the superiority of Aclotsaban, we need to consider the characteristics of each method and how they relate to our research question.

Firstly, let's define what we mean by "superiority." In this context, it means that Aclotsaban should be shown to prevent more thrombotic events than the current standard of care. This is a type of superiority trial, where the goal is to demonstrate that Aclotsaban has a better outcome compared to the existing treatment.

Now, let's examine each technique:

A. Per-protocol analysis: This method involves analyzing data from patients who actually completed the study protocol (i.e., those who followed the treatment as intended). While this can provide valuable insights into the efficacy of Aclotsaban, it may not be sufficient to prove superiority if many patients dropped out or failed to complete treatment.

B. Intention-to-treat analysis: This method involves analyzing data from all patients who were assigned to the study regardless of whether they completed the treatment as intended (per-protocol) or not. This approach can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the efficacy and safety of Aclotsaban, but it may not be ideal if many patients dropped out.

C. Sub-group analysis: This method involves analyzing data from specific subgroups within the study population (e.g., those who completed the treatment vs. those who did not). While this can provide valuable insights into the effects of Aclotsaban on different patient populations, it may not be sufficient to prove superiority if the results are not consistent across all subgroups.

D. Non-inferiority analysis: This method involves comparing Aclotsaban to a known standard treatment (in this case, the current standard of care) and determining whether Aclotsaban is non-inferior to that standard. If Aclotsaban is found to be non-inferior, it means that it does not significantly worse than the standard treatment, which would support its use as an alternative or add-on therapy.

Given our research question, we want to determine if Aclotsaban prevents more thrombotic events than the current standard of care. Therefore, a non-inferiority analysis is the most appropriate technique for attempting to prove the superiority of Aclotsaban.

The final answer is: D
