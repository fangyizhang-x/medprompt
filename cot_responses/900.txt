## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, let's analyze each option step by step:

A. Endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity: This condition is known as endometriosis, which can cause pelvic pain and infertility due to adhesions and inflammation. However, it would not typically cause painful diarrhea.

B. Smooth muscle tumor arising from the myometrium: A smooth muscle tumor in the uterus could potentially cause obstructive symptoms like painful diarrhea by compressing or blocking the fallopian tubes. This option seems plausible given the patient's symptoms of pelvic pain and painful diarrhea.

C. Primary failure of the ovaries: While ovarian failure can lead to infertility, it would not directly explain the patient's symptoms of pelvic pain and painful diarrhea.

D. Scarring of the fallopian tubes: Scarring from a previous ectopic pregnancy or other tubal damage could cause infertility but is less likely to be the primary cause of this patient's symptoms.

Considering these options, the most plausible explanation for the patient's symptoms (pelvic pain and painful diarrhea) would be related to a condition that affects the uterus and fallopian tubes. Option B, smooth muscle tumor arising from the myometrium, seems the most likely underlying cause given its potential to obstruct the fallopian tubes and cause these symptoms.

Therefore, the answer is B.
