## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine the strongest measure of association between maternal exposure to 2nd-hand smoke and low birth weight, we need to consider the design of the study.

Firstly, the study is a case-control study, where the subjects are selected based on their past exposure (in this case, living with or being in close proximity to a smoker) rather than their current exposure. This type of study is prone to selection bias and confounding variables.

Secondly, the study has a relatively small sample size (1,000 women), which may not be sufficient to detect a significant association between maternal exposure to 2nd-hand smoke and low birth weight.

Now, let's consider the options:

A. Odds ratio: This measure is commonly used in case-control studies to estimate the strength of association between a potential risk factor and an outcome. However, it assumes that the study has a sufficient sample size and controls for confounding variables.

B. Rate ratio: This measure is typically used in cohort studies or randomized controlled trials to compare the rates of an outcome between two groups. It's not directly applicable to case-control studies.

C. Absolute risk: This measure is also commonly used in case-control studies, but it assumes that the study has a sufficient sample size and controls for confounding variables.

D. Risk difference: This measure is typically used in randomized controlled trials or cohort studies to compare the risks of two groups. It's not directly applicable to case-control studies.

Given these considerations, the strongest measure of association that can be calculated from this study is likely to be the Odds Ratio (A). However, it's essential to note that the sample size may still be a limitation in detecting a significant association.

The final answer is: A
