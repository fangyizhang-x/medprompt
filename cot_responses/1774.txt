Given the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that secretes catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline). The presence of hypertension, headaches, abdominal pain, heart palpitations, and elevated plasma metanephrines are all consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption also increases his risk for pheochromocytoma. Additionally, the positive urine toxicology screening for THC suggests that he may be using cannabis, which can cause an increase in catecholamine levels.

Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in management is to control the patient's blood pressure and manage any symptoms of pheochromocytoma. Phenoxybenzamine (A) is a non-selective alpha-blocker that can be used to block the effects of excess catecholamines on the heart and blood vessels, reducing blood pressure. It is often used as an initial treatment for pheochromocytoma.

Propranolol (C) and Metoprolol (D) are beta-blockers that may also be used to control symptoms such as tachycardia and hypertension, but they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's condition. Propranolol is typically used for conditions such as hypertension or arrhythmias, while Metoprolol is often used for conditions such as angina or heart failure.

Resection of the adrenal mass (B) may be considered if the patient has a large tumor that is causing significant symptoms and is not responsive to medical management. However, this would typically be considered after other treatments have failed, and it carries significant risks associated with surgery.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management of this patient is to initiate treatment with phenoxybenzamine to control his blood pressure and manage any symptoms of pheochromocytoma.
