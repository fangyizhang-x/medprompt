Firstly, it's essential to understand that the patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, which is a sudden inflammation of the pancreas. This condition can be caused by various factors, including viral infections like HIV.

Given that the patient was recently started on combination anti-retroviral treatment (cART) including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz for her HIV infection, it's crucial to consider how these medications might interact with other medications or exacerbate pancreatitis. 

Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor that can increase the levels of other medications in the body, potentially leading to toxicity. Adding ritonavir to the HIV treatment regimen (Option A) could be problematic and may require careful consideration.

Nevirapine is another non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) that can also interact with protease inhibitors like efavirenz. Replacing efavirenz with nevirapine (Option B) might not be the best approach, as it could lead to increased levels of other medications and potentially worsen pancreatitis.

Lamivudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), which can interact differently with protease inhibitors compared to NNRTIs. Replacing didanosine with lamivudine (Option D) might not be the most critical concern in this scenario, as the primary issue is the interaction between ritonavir and other medications.

Hemoglobin levels are typically checked after pancreatitis resolves due to the risk of anemia or blood loss during treatment. Therefore, checking hemoglobin levels (Option C) would be a necessary precaution after pancreatitis resolves with treatment.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
