Given the clinical presentation of this 78-year-old woman, which includes lethargy, generalized weakness, short utterances, and non-contrast head CT showing normal age-related changes, the most likely diagnosis is a delirium or possibly a medication side effect. The patient's behavior of speaking in short utterances, not making eye contact, and being unresponsive to her environment suggests a possible decline in cognitive function.

The presence of 3-4 healing bruises on the upper extremities could be indicative of physical abuse, which is a concern given the patient lives with her son and daughter-in-law. The fact that she reports vague weakness for the last couple days further supports this suspicion.

Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be to investigate potential physical abuse. This can be done by asking the patient's son regarding the home situation (B). If the son is cooperative and provides a clear account of his interactions with the patient, it may reveal information about any potential abuse or neglect. However, if the son denies any wrongdoing or becomes agitated, further investigation would be warranted.

Performing a lumbar puncture (A) might be considered in cases of suspected meningitis or other conditions that could cause altered mental status and bruising, but there is no indication of these at this time. Asking the patient's son to leave the room (C) may not be necessary as it is essential to gather information from the patient herself. Calling Adult Protective Services to report the patient's son (D) might be premature without first attempting to gather more information through direct questioning.

Therefore, asking the patient's son regarding the home situation (B) is the most appropriate next step in management, as it may provide critical information about potential abuse or neglect that could impact the patient's safety and well-being.
