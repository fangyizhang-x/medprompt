Given the patient's symptoms of nocturia (waking up at night to urinate) despite avoiding liquids before bedtime, and his medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, along with current medications for these conditions, it is essential to consider non-invasive treatments that can address both the urinary frequency and potential underlying causes of his enlarged prostate.

Firstly, the patient's avoidance of fluids at night may contribute to nocturia. However, given his symptoms persist despite this avoidance, a more comprehensive approach is needed.

The physical examination findings of an enlarged prostate consistent with benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) are also important. BPE can cause urinary frequency and urgency due to the compression of the urethra by the enlarged prostate tissue.

Considering the patient's request for less invasive treatment options, we should evaluate medications that can help alleviate symptoms without causing significant side effects or compromising his quality of life.

A. Tamsulosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker (ARB) used to treat BPE by relaxing the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, making it easier to urinate. It does not cause significant dry mouth, which can be a concern for some patients due to its side effect profile.

B. Finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that reduces the size of the prostate over time, thereby alleviating symptoms of BPE. However, it may take several months to notice an improvement in urinary frequency and urgency.

C. Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor used primarily for treating erectile dysfunction (ED). It can also be used off-label for BPE due to its vasodilatory effects, which may help improve blood flow to the prostate. However, it does not directly address urinary frequency.

D. Leuprolide is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist that can reduce testosterone levels and shrink the prostate over time. While it can be effective for BPE, its side effects include hot flashes, mood changes, and decreased libido, which may not align with the patient's request for less invasive treatment.

Given these considerations, Tamsulosin is the most appropriate initial treatment option for this patient due to its efficacy in alleviating urinary frequency without significant side effects. It can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other treatments if necessary.

The final answer is: A
