## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario:

1. **Clinical presentation**: The 4-day-old boy presents with somnolence (sleepiness), poor feeding, vomiting after the first few feedings, and lethargy. These symptoms suggest a metabolic disorder affecting his energy metabolism.
2. **Markedly increased serum ammonia**: Elevated ammonia levels are often associated with disorders of amino acid metabolism, as ammonia is a byproduct of protein catabolism.
3. **Genetic analysis shows deficiency in N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS)**: This enzyme plays a crucial role in the urea cycle and is involved in the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate, which is necessary for the activity of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI). The absence or deficiency of NAGS would lead to impaired CPSI activity.

Given these points, let's consider the options:

A. **Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI)**: As mentioned, this enzyme is directly involved in the urea cycle and requires N-acetylglutamate as a cofactor for its activity. A deficiency in NAGS would lead to impaired CPSI activity, resulting in elevated ammonia levels.

B. **Ornithine translocase**: This enzyme is involved in the transport of ornithine across the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is necessary for the synthesis of polyamines and other compounds. While important for cellular metabolism, it is not directly related to the urea cycle or NAGS activity.

C. **Argininosuccinase**: This enzyme catalyzes the final step of the urea cycle, converting argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate. Its deficiency would lead to a different set of symptoms (e.g., lactic acidosis) and is not directly related to NAGS activity.

D. **Arginase**: This enzyme catalyzes the final step of the urea cycle, converting arginine into ornithine and urea. While it is also part of the urea cycle, its deficiency would lead to a different set of symptoms (e.g., lactic acidosis) and is not directly related to NAGS activity.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is A. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, as its deficiency
