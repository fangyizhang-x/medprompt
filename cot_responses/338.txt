## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, including difficulty swallowing, a foreign body sensation at the back of his throat, trouble breathing at night, and a physical examination finding of a midline mass at the base of the tongue, we can deduce that this is likely an acute obstruction. The fact that he has had similar symptoms in the past each time he has had an upper respiratory tract infection also supports this diagnosis.

The technetium-99m pertechnetate scan is particularly useful for identifying salivary gland abnormalities or ductal obstructions, which are consistent with a sublingual mass. The fact that the mass is nontender and rubbery on palpation further supports this diagnosis.

Considering the patient's history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, it is likely that he has an underlying condition that predisposes him to salivary gland dysfunction or ductal obstruction. Among the options provided:

A. Ductal obstruction of the sublingual salivary glands - This option is consistent with a sublingual mass and is supported by the patient's history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections.

B. Chronic infection of the palatine and lingual tonsils - While this could potentially cause swelling or discomfort, it does not explain the acute onset of symptoms or the specific finding of a midline mass at the base of the tongue.

C. Arrested endodermal migration from pharyngeal floor - This option is more related to the development of the pharynx and larynx rather than the formation of salivary gland masses.

D. Persistent epithelial tract between the foramen cecum and thyroid isthmus - This option refers to a condition known as the Wharton's duct cyst, which is typically found in the posterior third of the tongue. While it could cause swelling or discomfort, it does not explain the acute onset of symptoms or the specific finding of a midline mass at the base of the tongue.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely underlying cause of this patientâ€™s condition is ductal obstruction of the sublingual salivary glands.
