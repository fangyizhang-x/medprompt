## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The key to answering this question lies in understanding the pathophysiology behind the absence of a thyroid gland in a newborn, despite normal physical examination findings and mildly elevated TSH concentrations.

Firstly, let's consider option A: Transplacental transmission of thyroxine. While it is true that maternal thyroxine can cross the placenta and affect fetal development, there is no evidence to suggest that this mechanism explains the absence of a thyroid gland in the newborn.

Next, we need to examine option B: Presence of lingual thyroid tissue. The presence of lingual thyroid tissue (also known as lingual thyroid or lingual thyroid remnants) is indeed associated with congenital hypothyroidism. However, these remnants are typically small and not sufficient to account for the complete absence of both lobes of the thyroid gland in this patient.

Option C: Molecular mimicry of hCG subunit. This mechanism refers to the phenomenon where a molecule that mimics the structure of another molecule (in this case, the human chorionic gonadotropin subunit) can induce an immune response against it. While molecular mimicry is a well-documented mechanism in autoimmune thyroid diseases like Hashimoto's thyroiditis, it does not explain the absence of a thyroid gland in this patient.

Option D: Production of TSH-receptor antibodies. This option refers to the production of autoantibodies that target the TSH receptor, leading to decreased TSH secretion and hypothyroidism. The presence of mildly elevated TSH concentrations in this patient's newborn is consistent with this mechanism, as it would lead to a decrease in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.

Therefore, considering the options provided, the most plausible explanation for the normal physical examination findings despite the complete absence of a thyroid gland in the newborn is the production of TSH-receptor antibodies. This mechanism can lead to decreased TSH secretion and hypothyroidism without affecting the physical appearance or function of the thyroid gland itself.

The final answer is: D
