## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's presentation and diagnostic findings are highly suggestive of a dysgerminoma, a type of germ cell tumor that typically affects young women.

Firstly, the patient's symptoms of intermittent lower abdominal and pelvic pain localized to the right side without radiation are consistent with ovarian torsion or rupture, which is a surgical emergency. The presence of a tender palpable mass on the right adnexal structure further supports this diagnosis.

The histological evaluation of the tumor, which shows sheets of uniform cells resembling a 'fried egg', is characteristic of dysgerminoma. This type of tumor is known for its aggressive behavior and high likelihood of recurrence.

Given the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, it is essential to identify the most appropriate tumor marker associated with dysgerminoma.

- Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a nonspecific tumor marker that can be elevated in various types of cancer, including ovarian cancer. However, it is not specific for dysgerminoma.
- Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) is typically elevated in choriocarcinomas and some other germ cell tumors, but not commonly associated with dysgerminoma.
- Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a tumor marker that is often elevated in yolk sac tumors and certain types of hepatocellular carcinoma. It is not typically associated with dysgerminoma.
- Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) is a tumor marker that is commonly elevated in ovarian cancer, particularly epithelial ovarian cancers. While it can be elevated in some germ cell tumors, CA-125 is the most specific and sensitive tumor marker for ovarian cancer, including dysgerminoma.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings of this patient with dysgerminoma, the most likely elevated tumor marker is CA-125.

The final answer is D.
