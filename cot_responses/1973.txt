## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's analyze the situation:

1. The patient is a previously healthy 52-year-old woman with chest pain on exertion that lasts for 3 months.
2. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities, which suggests that the cardiac issue might not be related to structural heart disease or significant valvular problems.
3. Cardiac stress ECG shows inducible ST-segment depressions in precordial leads that coincide with the patient's report of chest pain and resolve upon cessation of exercise.

Given these findings, it is likely that the patient has angina pectoris, which is characterized by transient myocardial ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart muscle) during exertion. This condition is often associated with coronary artery disease (CAD).

Now, let's consider the effects of verapamil:

1. Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker that can cause vasodilation and reduce cardiac contractility.
2. It also has negative inotropic effects, which means it can decrease the heart's ability to contract.

Given these effects, we can analyze the answer choices as follows:

A. ↓ ↓ ↓ ↑: This option suggests that verapamil would have no effect on EDV (end-diastolic volume), blood pressure, contractility, and HR. However, this is unlikely given the negative inotropic effects of verapamil.

B. No change no change no change no change: This option suggests that verapamil would not affect any of these parameters. Given its negative inotropic effects, this is a plausible outcome.

C. ↓ ↓ no change ↑: This option suggests that verapamil would decrease EDV and blood pressure but have no effect on contractility and HR. However, the negative inotropic effects would likely lead to an increase in HR as the heart works harder to compensate for the decreased contractility.

D. ↑ ↓ ↓ ↓: This option suggests that verapamil would increase EDV, blood pressure, contractility, and HR. However, this is unlikely given its negative inotropic effects.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the patient's symptoms and the pharmacological effects of verapamil, the most likely set of effects is:

The final answer is: B
