Given the patient's presentation of diffuse swelling of her ankles and legs at 33 weeks gestation, accompanied by a significant increase in blood pressure (147/92 mmHg), this suggests that she may be experiencing preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is characterized by new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation and proteinuria (protein in the urine) or signs of end-organ damage.

The presence of bilateral edema, which is a hallmark of preeclampsia, further supports this diagnosis. The patient's past medical history of obesity and diabetes also increases her risk for developing preeclampsia.

Considering the severity of the presentation (diffuse swelling of ankles and legs) and the need to promptly address potential complications such as renal damage or stroke, the best next step in management is to perform a diagnostic test that can confirm the presence of proteinuria or assess for end-organ damage.

Option A, 24-hour urine protein, is the correct choice because it directly addresses the concern about proteinuria, which is a key component of preeclampsia. This test will help determine if the patient has significant protein loss in her urine, indicating renal involvement and potentially requiring further management.

Echocardiography (Option B) may be useful to assess for any cardiac complications associated with preeclampsia, but it is not the immediate next step given the patient's presentation. Reassurance and follow-up in 1 week (Option C) would be inappropriate as a first step due to the severity of her symptoms and the need for prompt intervention.

Spot protein to creatinine ratio (Option D) may provide some information about renal function, but it is not specific or sensitive enough to diagnose preeclampsia. It also does not address the concern about proteinuria.

Therefore, the best next step in management is to perform a 24-hour urine protein test to confirm the presence of significant proteinuria and assess for end-organ damage.
