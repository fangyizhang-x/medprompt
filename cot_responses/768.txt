Given the patient's immigration history, lack of routine childhood vaccinations, and current smoking status, it is essential to consider potential exposure to infectious diseases that may not be preventable through vaccination or treatment with standard medications.

The PPD skin test result indicates a positive reaction, which suggests an active infection. The induration size of 13 mm is considered significant enough to warrant further investigation.

Option A, performing interferon-γ release assay (IGRA), is the most appropriate initial step in managing this patient. IGRA tests are used to diagnose latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and can be positive even if the person has been vaccinated against TB or has a negative PPD test result. This is particularly relevant given the patient's immigration history, as LTBI can be acquired through close contact with an infected individual.

Option B, obtaining a chest x-ray, may be useful in certain contexts but is not the most appropriate initial step in this scenario. While it could help identify any pulmonary abnormalities that might be related to TB or other conditions, it does not address the patient's current symptoms or potential exposure risks.

Option C, administering isoniazid for 9 months, would be an inappropriate initial response without first confirming the diagnosis of active TB infection. Isoniazid is a standard treatment for latent TB infection but requires confirmation through a positive PPD test and/or culture to ensure that the patient has not developed active disease.

Option D, collecting sputum sample for culture, may be useful in certain contexts, such as diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis or monitoring treatment response. However, it would not be the initial step in managing this patient without first confirming the diagnosis of active TB infection through a positive PPD test and/or culture.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial step is to perform an interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) to diagnose latent TB infection and assess potential exposure risks.
