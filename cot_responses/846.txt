Given the patient's presentation of progressive back pain, tingling and burning sensation rising from his feet to knees bilaterally, difficulty urinating, bowel movements, weak leg flexion, and decreased anal sphincter tone, it is essential to consider a differential diagnosis that includes spinal cord injuries, disc herniation, or other conditions affecting the lower extremities.

The physical exam findings of decreased anal sphincter tone are particularly suggestive of an upper motor neuron lesion, which could be due to a spinal cord injury. The presence of tingling and burning sensations in the feet and knees also supports this possibility.

Considering these findings, the best next step in management would be to perform a lumbar puncture (LP) to evaluate for signs of central nervous system infection or inflammation, such as meningitis or encephalitis. This is because patients with spinal cord injuries are at increased risk of developing these conditions due to impaired protective mechanisms and potential contamination of the cerebrospinal fluid.

A lumbar puncture can help identify any abnormalities in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that may indicate an infection, inflammation, or other conditions. It is a non-invasive procedure that can be performed quickly and effectively, allowing for rapid assessment and decision-making regarding further management.

In contrast, emergency surgery (A) would be premature without first attempting to diagnose the cause of the patient's symptoms through LP. MRI (C) may provide additional information about the spinal cord or other structures, but it is not typically the first step in evaluating a patient with suspected spinal cord injury and lower extremity weakness.

Pulmonary function tests (D) are not relevant to this patient's presentation and would be more appropriate for assessing respiratory symptoms such as difficulty urinating or bowel movements.

Therefore, the best next step in management is to perform a lumbar puncture to evaluate for signs of central nervous system infection or inflammation.
