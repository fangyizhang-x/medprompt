(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's sudden onset of leg pain, coldness, pallor, diminished sensation, and muscle weakness in one leg compared to the other, it is highly suggestive of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). The presence of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of DVT due to the increased blood stasis.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with a DVT. The best next step in management should aim at confirming the diagnosis, reducing the risk of complications, and initiating appropriate treatment.

Option A (Graded exercise and aspirin) is not the best initial choice because it may not effectively reduce the risk of further clot formation or improve symptoms in the acute setting. Aspirin has antiplatelet effects but does not address the underlying cause of the thrombosis.

Option B (Heparin drip) is a reasonable next step, as heparin is an anticoagulant that can help prevent further clot formation and reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism. However, it should be started before imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis.

Option C (Surgical thrombectomy) is not indicated at this point without further evaluation and confirmation of the diagnosis through imaging studies such as D-dimer testing or CT venography.

Option D (Tissue plasminogen activator) is a thrombolytic agent that can dissolve clots but is typically reserved for patients with a high risk of bleeding complications, which are not indicated in this scenario.

Therefore, considering the need to confirm the diagnosis and reduce the risk of further clot formation or pulmonary embolism, starting heparin (Option B) is the best next step in management.
