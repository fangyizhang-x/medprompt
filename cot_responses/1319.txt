To address this question, let's break down the mechanisms of action for each class of drugs listed and how they relate to treating anxiety disorders.

A. Drugs that stimulate 5-HT1A receptors are typically used in the treatment of depression and certain anxiety disorders. These medications can help increase serotonin levels in the brain, which is often decreased in individuals with anxiety. Therefore, a drug that stimulates 5-HT1A receptors could be suitable for this patient's condition.

B. Drugs that block 5-HT reuptake are commonly used to treat depression and some anxiety disorders. By reducing the amount of serotonin available in the synaptic cleft, these medications can help alleviate symptoms of anxiety. So, a drug that blocks 5-HT reuptake could be suitable for this patient's condition.

C. Drugs that block both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake are typically used to treat depression and certain types of anxiety disorders. These medications can increase the availability of both serotonin and norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft, which can help improve mood and reduce anxiety symptoms. Therefore, a drug that blocks both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake could be suitable for this patient's condition.

D. Drugs that block dopamine 2 receptors are primarily used to treat schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. While there is some evidence suggesting that dopamine may play a role in mood regulation, blocking dopamine 2 receptors is not typically considered a first-line treatment for anxiety disorders. In fact, medications that target the serotonin system (like SSRIs) or the norepinephrine system (like SNRIs) are more commonly used to treat anxiety.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the answer is:
## Answer
(D) A drug that blocks dopamine 2 receptors
