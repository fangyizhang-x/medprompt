## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 2-year-old boy, we can analyze the symptoms and history to narrow down the possible causes.

1. **Frequent large-volume stools that are loose and greasy**: This symptom is suggestive of malabsorption or gastrointestinal issues.
2. **Recurrent respiratory tract infections since birth**: This indicates a potential issue with the immune system or an underlying condition affecting the lungs.
3. **Softening of the occipital and parietal bones on examination**: This finding, combined with scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi throughout both lung fields, suggests chronic lung disease.
4. **History of otitis media twice in the past year**: This could be related to his respiratory issues or another underlying condition.

Considering these points:

- **A. Deficient Î±1 antitrypsin** is a genetic disorder that can cause liver disease and lung disease (emphysema), but it's not directly linked to gastrointestinal symptoms like loose stools.
- **B. CFTR gene mutation**: This refers to Cystic Fibrosis, a condition characterized by thick mucus production in the lungs, which could explain his respiratory issues. However, it doesn't fully account for the gastrointestinal symptoms or softening of bones.
- **C. Absent T cells** is relevant because individuals with certain immunodeficiency disorders (like those with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome) can have recurrent infections and may also experience malabsorption due to impaired gut function.
- **D. Impaired ciliary function**: This option directly addresses the combination of symptoms, including respiratory issues (recurrent infections), gastrointestinal problems (loose stools), and signs of chronic lung disease (softening of bones).

Given the clinical presentation, impaired ciliary function is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms. Cilia are tiny hair-like structures in the lungs that help clear mucus and debris. Impaired ciliary function can lead to thickened mucus production, which can cause respiratory issues, as well as contribute to gastrointestinal problems due to malabsorption.

The final answer is: D
