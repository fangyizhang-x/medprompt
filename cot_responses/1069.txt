## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The absence of infection seen in this subset of participants can be explained by a genetic condition that affects the immune system's ability to respond to malaria.

Firstly, it is essential to understand that the question mentions "exposed population," which implies that these individuals have been previously exposed to malaria. This exposure is likely due to mosquito bites or other means of transmission.

The fact that 9% of the exposed population does not have clinical or laboratory evidence of malaria infection suggests that a significant portion of them may be resistant to the disease. To explain this, we need to consider the genetic basis of resistance to malaria.

Option A, "Inherited defect in erythrocyte membrane ankyrin protein," is related to hereditary spherocytosis, a condition characterized by abnormal red blood cells that are more prone to premature destruction. While it's possible for individuals with this condition to be resistant to malaria, there is no direct link between hereditary spherocytosis and resistance to Plasmodium infections.

Option B, "Defective X-linked ALA synthase gene," refers to a genetic disorder known as xeroderma pigmentosum. This condition is characterized by an inability to repair DNA damage caused by ultraviolet light, leading to skin cancer and other severe health issues. There is no direct link between xeroderma pigmentosum and resistance to malaria.

Option D, "Glutamic acid substitution in the β-globin chain," is related to sickle cell disease, a genetic disorder that affects hemoglobin production. While individuals with sickle cell disease may have increased susceptibility to certain infections due to impaired immune function, there is no direct link between sickle cell disease and resistance to malaria.

Option C, "Inherited mutation affecting ribosome synthesis," is the correct answer. This option refers to a genetic condition known as thalassemia major or beta-thalassemia. Individuals with thalassemia major have a deficiency in hemoglobin production due to mutations in the HBB gene that codes for the β-globin chain of hemoglobin. As a result, they are more susceptible to infections, including malaria, because their immune system is unable to effectively respond to the parasite.

In individuals with thalassemia major, the spleen is often enlarged and dysfunctional due to repeated episodes of anemia and infection. This can lead to the accumulation of infected red blood cells in
