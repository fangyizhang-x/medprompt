## Step 1: Analyze the given information and identify the key elements.
The question presents two scatter plots comparing the relationship between median income and weekly work hours on the difficulty of matching into specific specialties. Both associations are statistically significant.

## Step 2: Understand what statistical significance means in this context.
Statistical significance refers to whether the observed relationships between variables (in this case, median income and weekly work hours) are due to chance or if they actually exist. A p-value is often used to determine statistical significance; a low p-value indicates that the relationship is statistically significant.

## Step 3: Interpret the meaning of "statistically significant" in terms of the relationships between variables.
A statistically significant association means that there is a real, measurable difference between the median income and weekly work hours on the difficulty of matching into specific specialties. This implies that as one variable increases (median income), the other variable also tends to increase (weekly work hours) or decrease (difficulty of matching).

## Step 4: Compare the options based on the understanding from step 3.
- Option A suggests a direct relationship between the difficulty of matching and weekly work hours, which aligns with our interpretation that as median income increases, so does the difficulty of matching into specialties.
- Option B implies a stronger correlation between weekly work hours and difficulty of matching than between median income and difficulty. However, based on statistical significance alone, we cannot conclude this without further analysis.
- Option C suggests a stronger correlation between median income and difficulty of matching than between weekly work hours. This contradicts our interpretation that both variables are related to the difficulty of matching.
- Option D implies a direct relationship between median income and the length of weekly work hours, which is not supported by the given information.

## Step 5: Select the statement that best describes the results based on statistical significance alone.
Given that both associations are statistically significant, we can conclude that there is a real correlation between median income and the difficulty of matching into specific specialties. Therefore, the statement that best describes the results is A: The harder the specialty is to match into, the higher the weekly work hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$
