## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the treatment provided:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm and jaw, which is more severe during rest compared to exertion. This pattern is suggestive of angina pectoris.

2. **Past Medical History**: The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, all of which are risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD).

3. **EKG Findings**: ST segment depression on the EKG suggests myocardial ischemia or infarction, likely due to CAD.

4. **Treatment Provided**:
   - Aspirin is started as a first-line treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to its antiplatelet effects.
   - Oxygen and morphine are given for pain management.
   - A sublingual medication is administered. Given the context, it's likely that this medication is nitroglycerin.

5. **Physiologic Effect of Nitroglycerin**:
   - Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator that primarily affects venous capacitance vessels (capillaries and venules), leading to a decrease in preload.
   - Preload refers to the initial stretching of the cardiac myocytes prior to contraction, which is essentially the volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole. A decrease in preload reduces the amount of blood returning to the heart with each heartbeat, thereby reducing the workload on the heart and improving oxygen delivery to the myocardium.
   - While nitroglycerin also has some effects on afterload (due to its vasodilatory effect on arterial vessels), its primary and most significant physiologic effect in this context is a decrease in preload.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms of angina pectoris, past medical history, EKG findings, and treatment provided, the main physiologic effect of the sublingual medication administered to him would be a decrease in preload.
