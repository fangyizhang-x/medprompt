(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history and laboratory results, we can analyze the changes in his creatinine clearance to determine the most likely cause.

Firstly, let's consider the patient's past medical history:

- Osteopenia: This condition is characterized by a decrease in bone mineral density, which can lead to an increase in serum creatinine concentration due to impaired kidney function.
- Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones): While nephrolithiasis can cause an increase in serum creatinine concentration, it typically does not result in a significant change in creatinine clearance over time.
- Hypertension: This condition is associated with renal damage and increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which would lead to an increase in serum creatinine concentration. However, the patient's current GFR is normal, so this is less likely to be the cause of his current elevated creatinine levels.

Now, let's consider the laboratory results:

- Today: Serum creatinine concentration is 1.1 mg/dL, which is slightly elevated but still within a relatively normal range.
- Urine creatinine concentration is 100 mg/dL, which is significantly higher than the patient's past value of 120 mg/dL. This suggests that the kidneys are not filtering waste as efficiently as they used to.

Given these findings, we can rule out several options:

* Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is unlikely to cause a significant increase in serum creatinine concentration or a marked decrease in urine output.
* Normal aging is also unlikely, as kidney function typically declines with age.
* Renovascular disease is less likely, as the patient's current GFR is normal.

The most plausible explanation for these changes is that the kidneys are not filtering waste as efficiently as they used to. This could be due to a variety of factors, including:

* Osteopenia: The patient's osteopenia may be contributing to his decreased kidney function.
* Nephrolithiasis: Although nephrolithiasis can cause an increase in serum creatinine concentration, it is less likely to result in a significant change in creatinine clearance over time.

Therefore, the most likely cause of these changes in his creatinine clearance is osteopenia.
