To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the attending physician's suspicion:

1. **Sudden onset of skin rash**: This suggests an acute condition rather than a chronic one.
2. **Progressive worsening of the rash**: Indicates that the condition is likely to be self-limiting or has a rapid progression.
3. **Erythematous, vesicular lesions on hands and nape of the neck**: These are characteristic skin manifestations often associated with porphyrias.
4. **Tense bullae over dorsum of both hands**: This further supports the diagnosis of a porphyria.

Given these points, we need to identify which precursor is most likely elevated in this patient, who is suspected of having a defect in heme synthesis due to an attending physician's suspicion of a porphyria.

Porphyrias are a group of disorders caused by defects in the biosynthesis of heme. The precursors listed as options can be related to different types of porphyrias:

- **Uroporphyrinogen III (A)**: This is associated with Uroporphyrinogen Decarboxylase (UROD) deficiency, a type of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP typically presents with acute abdominal pain, neurological symptoms, and sometimes skin manifestations.
  
- **Hydroxymethylbilane (B)**: This is involved in the early steps of heme synthesis. Defects in this enzyme can lead to erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), which primarily affects the skin but can also have neurological symptoms.

- **Porphobilinogen (C)**: This precursor is directly related to the early stages of heme synthesis and defects in porphobilinogen deaminase (PBD) or other enzymes involved in this pathway. It's associated with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP).

- **δ-Aminolevulinic acid (D)**: While δ-Aminolevulinic acid is a precursor in the heme biosynthesis pathway, defects leading to its accumulation are more commonly associated with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) rather than acute porphyrias.

Considering the patient's symptoms and the likely diagnosis of an acute porphyria, the most relevant precursor related to the early stages of heme synthesis is **Porphobilin
