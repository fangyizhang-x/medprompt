## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To solve this question, let's consider the anatomy and function of the structures involved.

The parotid gland is a salivary gland located on each side of the face, below and in front of the ears. It has several branches that supply taste sensation to the anterior 2/3 of the tongue (A1 nerve) and motor innervation to the lateral pterygoid muscle, which helps in opening the jaw.

The nerve that passes through the parotid gland is the **VII cranial nerve**, also known as the facial nerve. This nerve has several branches, including the chorda tympani, which carries taste sensation from the anterior 2/3 of the tongue (A1 nerve), and the greater petrosal nerve, which provides motor innervation to the stapedius muscle in the middle ear.

Given that the injury involves a nerve that also passes through the parotid gland, we can infer that the affected nerve is likely the **VII cranial nerve**. Therefore, the possible consequence of this injury would be related to the loss of taste sensation from the anterior 2/3 of the tongue (A1 nerve).

The other options are not directly related to the parotid gland or the VII cranial nerve.

Therefore, the answer is A. Loss of taste from posterior 1/3 of tongue
