Given the patient's current presentation and laboratory results, the most appropriate management would be to address the hypercalcemia causing his symptoms.

Firstly, let's consider the patient's symptoms: perioral numbness. This symptom is often associated with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels), which can cause nerve damage leading to numbness around the mouth. However, in this context, it could also be related to hyperparathyroidism-induced hypocalcemia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated PTH levels, which are a hallmark of primary hyperparathyroidism. This condition is characterized by an overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to increased calcium levels in the blood and subsequent symptoms such as kidney stones, dehydration, and bone disease.

Given that the patient is already on the surgical floor recovering from surgery, it's essential to manage his current hypercalcemia promptly to prevent further complications. The most effective way to do this is by administering a calcium gluconate bolus to rapidly correct the hypercalcemia.

Calcium gluconate is a rapid-acting calcium supplement that can help stabilize blood calcium levels and alleviate symptoms such as perioral numbness, muscle weakness, and cardiac arrhythmias associated with severe hypercalcemia. It's also essential to monitor the patient closely for any signs of hypocalcemia or other complications.

The other options are not appropriate management strategies in this scenario:

- Observation (B) would be inappropriate given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.
- Potassium (C) is not directly related to managing hypercalcemia caused by PTH elevation.
- Vitamin D (D) may have some role in calcium homeostasis, but it is not the most effective treatment for acute hypercalcemia.

Therefore, the correct management of this patient would be to administer a calcium gluconate bolus to rapidly correct his hypercalcemia and alleviate symptoms.
