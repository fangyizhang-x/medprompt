## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can analyze the possible diagnoses as follows:

1. **Insidious onset of shoulder pain**: This suggests a chronic condition rather than an acute trauma or injury.
2. **Limited range of motion (ROM) with specific limitations in forward flexion, abduction, external rotation, and internal rotation**: These movements are crucial for shoulder function and indicate a mechanical issue affecting the joint.
3. **Pain on movement**: The patient's pain worsens with movement, which is consistent with a condition that causes inflammation or irritation of the joint.
4. **Normal rotator cuff strength**: This suggests that the primary issue may not be related to muscle weakness or tendon dysfunction.
5. **AP, scapular Y, and axillary plain film radiographs are reported as normal**: These tests typically assess for bone or joint abnormalities, which is less likely in this case.

Considering these points:

- **Degenerative cervical spine disease (A)**: While possible, the primary complaint is shoulder pain, not neck pain.
- **Adhesive capsulitis (B)**: Also known as frozen shoulder, it typically presents with stiffness and limited ROM, but the patient's symptoms are more acute and involve specific movements rather than a gradual onset of stiffness.
- **Rotator cuff injury (C)**: The normal rotator cuff strength and lack of significant weakness or pain on palpation make this less likely. Additionally, the primary issue is not related to muscle function.
- **Glenohumeral arthritis (D)**: This condition typically presents with a gradual onset of pain and stiffness in the shoulder, which aligns with the patient's symptoms. The limited ROM and specific movements also support this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is Glenohumeral arthritis.

The final answer is: D
