Given the clinical presentation of a 7-year-old boy experiencing spells of unresponsiveness and upward rolling of the eyes that last for a few seconds, followed by no response to voice or purposeful movements, we can infer that these episodes are likely related to absence seizures. The fact that the episodes occur multiple times during the day and are accompanied by EEG findings of 3 Hz spike-and-slow-wave discharges (also known as polyspikes) on hyperventilation is highly suggestive of absence seizures.

Absence seizures are characterized by brief, sudden lapses in consciousness without loss of postural control or convulsions. The fact that the boy continues what he was doing before the spell and does not lose his posture or fall to the ground further supports this diagnosis.

Given the diagnosis of absence seizures, pharmacotherapy is typically aimed at controlling the frequency and severity of these episodes. Ethosuximide (A) is a first-line treatment for absence seizures due to its efficacy in reducing seizure frequency and improving quality of life. Lamotrigine (B) can also be effective in treating absence seizures but may take longer to start working compared to ethosuximide. Sodium valproate (C) is another commonly used medication for absence seizures, although it may have a slower onset of action.

Given the above considerations, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time would be Ethosuximide (A), as it has been shown to be effective in controlling absence seizures and is generally well-tolerated.
