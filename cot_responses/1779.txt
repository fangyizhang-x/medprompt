## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's consider the options one by one:

A. Fibrates are known to cause skin reactions such as pruritus and erythema (redness), but significant skin flushing is not a commonly reported side effect. Therefore, option A is unlikely to be correct.

B. There is limited evidence to suggest that fibrates potentiate the risk of myositis when given with statins. In fact, some studies have shown that statins and fibrates can be used together safely in patients with cardiovascular disease. So, option B seems plausible but not strongly supported by the current literature.

C. Fibrates are known to increase the risk of cataracts, particularly with long-term use. This is because they can cause changes in the lens of the eye that may lead to clouding or opacification. Therefore, option C is a well-established fact and a potential concern for this patient.

D. Fibrates inhibit the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, which means they actually increase HDL (good) cholesterol levels by promoting the conversion of VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) to LDL (low-density lipoprotein). So, option D is incorrect.

Given the analysis above, the correct answer is C. Fibrates can increase the risk of cataracts.

Therefore, the answer is C
