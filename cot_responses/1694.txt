To address this question, let's break down the key components and considerations for preconception care in a healthy 27-year-old woman.

### Key Considerations:
- **Vaccination History:** The patient is up-to-date on her vaccination history. This includes the flu vaccine annually.
- **Lifestyle Factors:**
  - She denies tobacco use, which is generally recommended to be avoided before conception due to its potential effects on fetal development and maternal health.
  - Her alcohol consumption (2 glasses of wine per week) is also a concern but does not directly impact her ability to conceive or carry a pregnancy to term. However, it's worth noting that moderate alcohol consumption may increase the risk of miscarriage.

### Recommendations for Preconception Care:
- **Folic Acid Supplementation:** Given her age and potential risk of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), starting folic acid supplementation is highly recommended. This can be done as early as 12 weeks of pregnancy, but it's often started earlier in the first trimester to ensure adequate levels are reached before conception.
  
- **Inactivated Influenza Vaccination:** The flu vaccine is crucial for preventing influenza during pregnancy, which can have serious complications for both mother and fetus. It's recommended annually.

- **Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccination:** This vaccine is also important to prevent congenital rubella syndrome in the fetus if the mother becomes infected with the rubella virus during pregnancy.

- **Varicella Zoster Titer:** The varicella zoster titer (also known as a chickenpox vaccination) is typically recommended for women who have not been vaccinated against chickenpox. However, since this patient has no prior history of chickenpox and is otherwise healthy, it might not be immediately necessary.

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided and considering the standard recommendations for preconception care in a healthy woman, the option that stands out as NOT recommended at this stage would be obtaining a varicella zoster titer. This patient has no prior history of chickenpox or exposure to the virus, making vaccination against it not immediately necessary.

The final answer is:
## Answer
Therefore, the answer is D.
