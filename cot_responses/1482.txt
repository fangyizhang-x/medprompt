Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can narrow down the differential diagnosis based on the characteristics of each condition.

Firstly, let's consider the location and nature of the blisters. The presence of multiple, flaccid blisters on the volar surface of the forearm with a total body surface area (TBSA) involvement of 10% is highly suggestive of an autoimmune blistering disease. The fact that the epidermis separates when lightly stroked further supports this diagnosis.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

A. Lichen planus: Typically presents with purplish, itchy, flat bumps on the skin, mucous membranes, or nails. It doesn't typically cause flaccid blisters or a TBSA involvement of 10%.

B. Dermatitis herpetiformis: Characterized by intensely itchy, blistering rash, often on the elbows, knees, and buttocks. The blisters are usually vesicular, not flaccid, and have a different appearance.

C. Bullous pemphigoid: A chronic autoimmune disease that causes large, tense blisters on the skin, typically on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs. While it can cause significant blistering, the TBSA involvement is usually less than 10%.

D. Pemphigus vulgaris: An autoimmune disease characterized by flaccid blisters on the skin and mucous membranes, often with a TBSA involvement greater than 10%. The blisters are typically vesicular, not flaccid.

Considering these characteristics, the most likely diagnosis is D. Pemphigus vulgaris, given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and the presence of multiple, flaccid blisters on the skin with a TBSA involvement of 10%.

The reason for this conclusion is that pemphigus vulgaris typically presents with flaccid blisters, a high TBSA involvement, and often involves mucous membranes. The patient's symptoms, including pain in her left cheek when eating (suggestive of oral mucosal involvement) and pain during sexual intercourse (suggestive of genital mucosa involvement), further support this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely due to the following reasons:

- Lichen planus is characterized by purplish, itchy bumps on the skin or mucous membranes.
- Dermatitis herpetiformis
