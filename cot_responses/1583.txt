## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a normal distribution and how they apply to the given data.

First, let's recall that in a normal distribution, about 68% of the values lie within one standard deviation (SD) of the mean. This is known as the 68-95-99.7 rule or empirical rule.

Given:
- Mean (μ) = 200 mg/dL
- Standard Deviation (σ) = 50 mg/dL

We want to find out how many people have a cholesterol level less than 300 mg/dL.

To do this, we need to calculate the z-score for 300 mg/dL. The z-score tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean our value is.

z = (X - μ) / σ
= (300 - 200) / 50
= 100 / 50
= 2

Now, we need to find the probability that a randomly selected person has a cholesterol level less than 300 mg/dL. This corresponds to the area under the normal curve to the left of z = 2.

Using a standard normal distribution table (z-table), we look up the z-score of 2 and find the corresponding probability:

P(Z < 2) ≈ 0.9772

This means that about 97.72% of the population has a cholesterol level less than 300 mg/dL.

Since there are 1000 participants in total, to find out how many people have a cholesterol level less than 300 mg/dL, we multiply the total number of participants by the probability:

Number of people with LDL < 300 mg/dL = Total participants × Probability
= 1000 × 0.9772
≈ 975

Therefore, the answer is C.
