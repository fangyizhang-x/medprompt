## Step 1: Assess the situation and identify key factors.
The patient is a 76-year-old man with an intracranial hemorrhage, showing signs of severe brain injury (non-responsive, withdrawing only to pain, not opening eyes). He has progressed to renal failure and deteriorated mental status. The family members have differing opinions on his end-of-life care.

## Step 2: Consider the patient's medical condition and its implications for decision-making.
Given the patient's severe brain injury and potential for further decline or deterioration, withdrawing life-sustaining treatments (like fluids and antibiotics) might be considered to prioritize comfort. However, this must be balanced against the family members' wishes.

## Step 3: Evaluate the role of durable power of attorney in medical decision-making.
The wife is identified as the patient's durable power of attorney, which means she has the legal authority to make decisions on his behalf regarding end-of-life care. This is a critical factor because it indicates that the family members' wishes may not be legally binding.

## Step 4: Consider the ethical implications and potential conflicts.
There are potential conflicts between the wife's expressed wishes (to withdraw care) and her daughter's desire to continue all care, which could lead to an ethical dilemma. The physician team must navigate these differences while also respecting the patient's autonomy as defined by his durable power of attorney.

## Step 5: Develop a plan that respects the patient's autonomy while addressing family concerns.
Given the wife's legal authority and the potential conflict with her daughter's wishes, the most appropriate course of action would be to listen to both parties' opinions but also consider the best interests of the patient. This might involve compromising between the two families by withdrawing fluids and antibiotics but keeping the patient intubated.

## Step 6: Consider the legal implications.
It is essential to note that the wife's authority as durable power of attorney may not override her daughter's wishes in all situations, especially if they conflict with the patient's best interests. However, in this scenario, it appears that the family members' differing opinions could lead to a situation where the physician must make a decision based on the patient's current condition and the legal framework governing end-of-life care.

## Step 7: Choose the best course of action.
Based on the analysis, the most appropriate response would be to compromise between the wife's wishes (to withdraw care) and her daughter's desire to continue all care. This approach respects both
