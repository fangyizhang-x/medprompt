(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the scenario, we need to consider the potential risks associated with each infection in relation to breastfeeding.

- **A. Hepatitis B**: While hepatitis B can be transmitted through breast milk, it is not typically considered an absolute contraindication to breastfeeding. In fact, hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine are often given to newborns to prevent the transmission of the virus.
  
- **B. Hepatitis C**: Similar to hepatitis B, hepatitis C can be transmitted through breast milk, but it is not an absolute contraindication. The risk of transmission depends on various factors, including the mother's viral load and the baby's age at birth.

- **C. Latent tuberculosis (TB)**: TB is a significant concern in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with high TB prevalence. However, if the mother has been infected with latent TB, she can still be treated for it before breastfeeding. In fact, the World Health Organization recommends that mothers with latent TB infection should receive treatment before initiating breastfeeding.

- **D. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)**: HIV is a major concern in many countries, especially Sub-Saharan Africa. However, if the mother has been infected with HIV and is receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), she can be safely initiated on breastfeeding. In fact, the World Health Organization recommends that HIV-positive mothers should start breastfeeding as soon as possible after initiation of ART.

Therefore, considering the options provided, **Hepatitis C** stands out as an absolute contraindication to breastfeeding due to its potential for transmission through breast milk and the need for prompt treatment before initiating breastfeeding.

The final answer is: B
