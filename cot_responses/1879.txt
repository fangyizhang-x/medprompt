## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms of right hip pain, progressive loss of hearing, and radiographic findings of expanded bony cortices and coarsened trabeculae in both hips and skull, along with laboratory evidence of isolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase without abnormalities in serum calcium or phosphate levels, we can deduce that the patient likely has a bone disorder.

The presence of multiple areas of expanded bony cortices and coarsened trabeculae in both hips and skull suggests a systemic condition affecting bone metabolism. The laboratory findings further support this, as they indicate an isolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase without abnormalities in serum calcium or phosphate levels.

Considering the histologic options provided:

A. Immature woven bone with collagen fibers arranged irregularly - This is characteristic of osteomalacia, which typically presents with softening of the bones due to a deficiency of vitamin D or its active metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. While it could explain some of the patient's symptoms, it does not fully account for the radiographic findings.

B. Mature lamellar bone with collagen fibers arranged in lamellae - This is characteristic of osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disorder that affects the production of collagen, leading to fragile bones and increased risk of fractures. However, it would not typically cause progressive loss of hearing or isolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase.

C. Chondroblasts and chondrocytes forming a cartilaginous matrix - This is characteristic of osteochondritis dissecans, which can cause pain and damage to the joint cartilage. While it could explain some of the patient's symptoms, it does not fully account for the radiographic findings.

D. Large pleomorphic cells with numerous atypical mitotic figures and “lacey” osteoid formation - This is characteristic of Paget's disease of bone, a condition that involves abnormal breakdown and regrowth of bone tissue, leading to deformities and increased risk of fractures. The isolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase without abnormalities in serum calcium or phosphate levels is consistent with this diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely histologic finding if one of the lesions were biopsied would be Paget's disease of bone, given the patient's symptoms, radiographic findings, and laboratory evidence.
