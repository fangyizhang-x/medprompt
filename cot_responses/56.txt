Given the clinical presentation of a 48-year-old man with HIV, we can analyze the key points to determine the most likely cause of his skin lesions.

Firstly, the patient's symptoms are non-specific but include multiple skin-colored papules over his face and neck with a dimpled center. The presence of cervical lymphadenopathy also suggests an infectious or inflammatory process.

The patient's HIV status is relevant as it increases his susceptibility to opportunistic infections (OIs). However, in this case, the absence of fever, sore throat, or other systemic symptoms makes it less likely that he has a bacterial infection like candidal esophagitis.

The patient's treatment history with lamivudine, abacavir, and efavirenz is also important. These antiretroviral medications are not typically associated with skin lesions as a side effect.

Considering the patient's physical examination findings, we can rule out some options:

- **Bartonella** (A) is more commonly associated with cat-scratch disease or other cutaneous manifestations.
- **Poxvirus** (C) infections, such as smallpox or molluscum contagiosum, are less likely given the patient's HIV status and lack of fever.

The most plausible explanation for this patient's findings is a viral infection that can cause skin lesions in immunocompromised individuals. Among the remaining options:

- **Papillomavirus** (B) is a leading cause of cutaneous lesions in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV. Human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly types 6 and 11, are known to cause genital warts but can also lead to skin lesions on the face and neck.
- **Coccidioides** (D) is a fungal pathogen that typically causes respiratory infections in immunocompromised individuals. While it can disseminate to other parts of the body, including the skin, it is less likely given the patient's presentation.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and HIV status, the most likely cause of this patient's findings is **B. Papillomavirus**, specifically HPV type 6 or 11, which can lead to cutaneous lesions in immunocompromised individuals.

The final answer is: B
