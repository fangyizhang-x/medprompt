Given the patient's history of chronic sinus infections and recent hospitalization for suspected pneumonia with hemoptysis, it is plausible that he has a condition known as pyelonephritis or possibly another form of vasculitis affecting the kidneys. The presence of bilateral pitting edema, significantly elevated serum creatinine (3.4 mg/dL), and blood urea nitrogen (35 mg/dL) along with decreased urine output indicate severe kidney dysfunction.

The key findings here are:
- Bilateral pitting edema
- Severe renal impairment (elevated creatinine)
- Hemoptysis, which can be a sign of pulmonary vasculitis or another systemic condition affecting the kidneys

Crescent-shaped glomeruli on light microscopy are highly suggestive of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), a syndrome characterized by a rapid decline in kidney function over weeks to months. This is often associated with severe inflammation and damage to the glomeruli.

Immunofluorescent microscopy showing crescent-shaped deposits would be most consistent with this diagnosis, as RPGN typically involves the deposition of immune complexes (antibodies) in the glomeruli, leading to their destruction and crescent formation. This is a hallmark feature of several types of vasculitis affecting the kidneys.

Given these considerations:
- Subendothelial deposits are more commonly associated with conditions like membranous nephropathy.
- Mesangial deposits can be seen in various glomerulonephritides, including IgA nephropathy and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, but not typically as a hallmark of RPGN.
- Subepithelial deposits are characteristic of membranous nephropathy.
- No deposits would suggest a different diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely finding on immunofluorescent microscopy in this patient is subepithelial deposits, which are consistent with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.
