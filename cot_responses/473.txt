## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's presentation suggests a traumatic injury to the shoulder, specifically involving the rotator cuff muscles and tendons.

1. **Mechanism of Injury**: The patient fell onto his outstretched hand, which is consistent with a fall onto an outstretched hand (also known as a "dorsal" or "outward" fall). This mechanism can cause injuries to the shoulder joint and surrounding structures.
2. **Symptoms**: The patient's pain and difficulty moving his right shoulder are consistent with rotator cuff tendinitis or tears, which are common after falls onto an outstretched hand.
3. **Physical Examination Findings**:
   - The inability to abduct the right shoulder above his head initially suggests a problem with the supraspinatus tendon, as this muscle is responsible for abduction of the arm.
   - The ability to do so only when assisted indicates that the injury may be related to the supraspinatus tendon or another structure that requires assistance to move.
4. **MRI Findings**: Although not described in detail, an MRI would likely show signs consistent with a rotator cuff injury, such as:
   - Tears or degenerative changes in the supraspinatus tendon
   - Inflammation or edema of the surrounding soft tissues (e.g., labrum, tendons)
5. **Other Considerations**:
   - The absence of sensory loss and normal vital signs makes other potential injuries less likely.
   - The patient's unremarkable past medical history and lack of systemic symptoms make other conditions less likely.

Based on these findings, the most likely injured structure is the supraspinatus tendon, which is responsible for abduction of the arm. This conclusion is supported by the patient's inability to abduct his shoulder initially and the need for assistance to move it fully.

The final answer is: A
