## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation with hematuria and right flank pain, along with the intravenous pyelogram findings of multiple cysts in the medulla, we can consider several potential diagnoses.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option:

A. Simple retention cysts: These are typically found in children and are not consistent with the patient's age or presentation.

B. Acquired polycystic kidney disease (APKD): This condition is characterized by the growth of numerous cysts filled with fluid in the kidneys, often due to genetic mutations. While APKD can cause hematuria and flank pain, it typically presents at a younger age than 40.

C. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD): This is the most common inherited disorder causing kidney cysts. It usually presents in adulthood, with a peak incidence between ages 30-50. ADPKD can cause hematuria and flank pain due to the growth of cysts in the kidneys.

D. Medullary sponge kidney: This condition involves the formation of cystic dilatations in the medulla of the kidneys. While it can cause hematuria, it is typically associated with a more gradual onset and may not fully explain the patient's flank pain.

Considering these factors, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), as it aligns with his age, presentation, and family history of recurrent urinary tract infections. ADPKD can cause multiple cysts in the medulla, leading to hematuria and flank pain.

The final answer is: C
