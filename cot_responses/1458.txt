## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of a prickling sensation in the left anteromedial thigh and lower leg, decreased patellar reflex on the left, and decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch, along with decreased strength on hip flexion and knee extension, we can narrow down the possible causes.

Firstly, let's consider the location of the symptoms. The anteromedial aspect of the thigh and lower leg is innervated by the femoral nerve. Therefore, damage to the femoral nerve could explain the sensory deficits.

The decreased patellar reflex on the left suggests involvement of the S1 nerve root, which is responsible for the motor control of the quadriceps muscles (responsible for knee extension) and also has a role in the patellar reflex. However, this symptom alone does not necessarily point to an S1 radiculopathy.

The decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch on the anteromedial thigh and medial lower leg suggests involvement of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN), which is responsible for these sensations. The LFCN is a branch of the femoral nerve, so damage to it could explain this symptom.

The decreased strength on hip flexion and knee extension also points towards an issue with the S1 radiculopathy or possibly the S2 radiculopathy, as both of these nerves are involved in the innervation of these muscles. However, given the specific pattern of weakness (3/5 on hip flexion and 2/5 on knee extension), it is more likely that we are dealing with an issue affecting the LFCN.

Considering all the symptoms together, the most likely underlying cause is a S1 radiculopathy, specifically involving the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. This would explain the sensory deficits, decreased patellar reflex, and weakness on hip flexion and knee extension.

Therefore, the answer is D.
