Given the patient's presentation with a pruritic rash on his right forearm, which has been ongoing for 1 week and is not accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, joint pain, or skin lesions that would suggest an infectious process, we can consider several possible diagnoses. However, considering the lack of allergies and the absence of household pets, we should initially rule out conditions that are more commonly associated with these factors.

The rash on the forearm could be suggestive of a few dermatological conditions, but given its pruritic nature and limited context, we might lean towards a condition that is not typically associated with scratching or other forms of self-trauma. One such possibility is a form of psoriasis, which can present as erythematous plaques on the skin.

Psoriasis is an autoimmune condition characterized by an overactive immune response leading to excessive skin cell production, resulting in thickened, scaly, and often itchy skin lesions. Given that this patient has not had a similar rash before, it's possible that he may be experiencing psoriasis for the first time or has recently started.

Considering the treatment options provided:

A. Oral acitretin - This is a systemic retinoid used in the treatment of severe psoriasis, particularly in patients who do not respond to topical treatments. It's typically reserved for more severe cases and is associated with significant side effects.

B. Topical clotrimazole - Clotrimazole is an antifungal medication that can be used topically to treat various fungal infections, including those affecting the skin. However, it would not be appropriate as a first-line treatment for psoriasis.

C. Topical hydrocortisone - Hydrocortisone cream or ointment is a mild steroid that can be used to reduce inflammation and itching associated with various skin conditions, including psoriasis. It's often the first line of treatment due to its efficacy in reducing symptoms without causing significant systemic side effects.

D. Topical salicylic acid - Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid that can help exfoliate the skin, reduce inflammation, and promote healing. While it may be used in some cases of psoriasis, especially for scaling or thickening lesions, it's not typically the first choice due to its potential for irritation.

Given the patient's presentation and the need for a treatment that is both effective and safe, topical hydrocortisone would
