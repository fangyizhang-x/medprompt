## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To answer this question, let's break down the key concepts and apply them to the scenario:

1. **Primordial Prevention**: This is the most general form of prevention, aiming to prevent the emergence or development of risk factors in a population before they occur. It doesn't directly address the detection or treatment of existing conditions.

2. **Primary Prevention**: This involves preventing the occurrence of a disease or condition before it happens. It includes measures such as vaccination, healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding smoking. Since the fecal occult blood test is used to detect potential colorectal cancer in asymptomatic individuals, this falls under primary prevention.

3. **Secondary Prevention**: This focuses on early detection and treatment of a disease or condition that has already developed but can still be cured or managed effectively. Screening tests like the one mentioned are examples of secondary prevention because they aim to identify diseases at an early stage when they are more treatable, thereby preventing further progression or complications.

4. **Tertiary Prevention**: This involves managing and reducing the impact of an ongoing illness or injury that has lasting effects. The goal is to improve the quality of life for individuals with chronic conditions by minimizing their symptoms and complications. While screening tests can contribute to tertiary prevention by identifying diseases early, the primary purpose here is not to manage a condition but rather to detect it.

Given this analysis, the fecal occult blood test recommended for this patient's routine check-up best fits into **B. Primary Prevention** because it aims to prevent colorectal cancer from developing in individuals who are asymptomatic and at average risk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{B}$
