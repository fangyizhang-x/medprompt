(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of a painful tongue lesion with an acute onset, accompanied by headache and radiating to the right eye, along with multiple knot-like swellings on the left temple, it is highly suggestive of a subacute bacterial thrombophlebitis (SBT), also known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) complicated by infection. This condition is often associated with migraines.

The patient's past medical history of hypertension and recurrent migraines further supports this diagnosis. The physical examination findings, including the multiple knot-like swellings on the left temple, are consistent with SBT or DVT.

Laboratory findings, such as elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicate an inflammatory process. The presence of a high leukocyte count with a predominance of neutrophils further supports this diagnosis.

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the next best step in the management of this patient is to initiate treatment for SBT or DVT. 

A CT scan would be useful for evaluating the extent of the thrombophlebitis but is not typically the first-line imaging modality for suspected SBT/DVT.

Lysis therapy (B) may be considered if there are signs of severe infection, such as fever above 38Â°C, or if the patient has a high risk of bleeding. However, it is not the immediate next step in management.

High-dose systemic corticosteroids (C) may be used to reduce inflammation and prevent further complications but are typically reserved for more severe cases or those with significant organ involvement.

Paracetamol (D) would be an appropriate initial treatment for pain relief, given its analgesic properties. However, it is not sufficient as a standalone treatment for SBT/DVT.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to initiate anticoagulation therapy to prevent further clot formation and promote healing of the thrombophlebitis. This can be achieved with either heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as initial anticoagulant therapy.
