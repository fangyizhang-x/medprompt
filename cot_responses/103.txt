## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's HIV status, current medications (abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine), and the presence of multiple lesions on his chest and lower extremities that have progressively increased in size without pain or pruritus, we can deduce the following:

1. **Lesions are not painful or pruritic**: This suggests that the lesions are likely benign rather than malignant.
2. **CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 450/mm3 (normal â‰¥ 500/mm3)**: A CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 450/mm3 indicates a relatively healthy immune system, which makes opportunistic infections more likely to be the cause of the lesions rather than AIDS-defining illnesses.
3. **Skin biopsy shows multiple spindle-shaped cells and lymphocytic infiltrate**: The presence of spindle-shaped cells (which could represent a variety of cell types including T-cells or other immune cells) and lymphocytic infiltrate is indicative of an inflammatory process.

Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is **cutaneous T-cell lymphoma**. This condition is more common in individuals with HIV/AIDS, particularly those with lower CD4+ counts.

Given the options provided:

- **A. Ganciclovir**: An antiviral medication used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, which can be opportunistic in immunocompromised patients.
- **B. Nitazoxanide**: An antiprotozoal medication that is effective against various parasites but not typically used as a first-line treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
- **C. Alpha-interferon**: A medication used to treat viral infections and some types of cancer, including hairy cell leukemia. It's not the primary treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
- **D. Amphotericin B**: An antifungal medication that is effective against a wide range of fungal infections but not typically used as a first-line treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

Given the diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be an immunosuppressive agent to control the immune response and reduce tumor growth. **Ganciclovir** is often used in combination with other medications (such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants) for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

Therefore,
