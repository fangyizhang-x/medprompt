## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given that the patient has a mutation in the gene encoding for the L-type calcium channel protein, which is crucial for regulating cardiac muscle contraction, we can infer that his heart's ability to generate and propagate an action potential might be affected. The ventricular action potential is primarily generated by the rapid depolarization phase (phase 0), followed by repolarization phases (phases 1-4).

The L-type calcium channel plays a key role in controlling the influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle cells during phase 0, which is essential for initiating the action potential. A mutation in this gene could lead to an abnormality in the regulation of calcium ion flow, potentially affecting the ventricular action potential.

Considering the options provided:

A. Abnormal phase 1 - This would be expected as a result of impaired calcium influx during phase 0, which is crucial for initiating the action potential.

B. Abnormal phase 4 - While repolarization phases are affected in various cardiac conditions, an abnormality specifically in phase 4 is less directly related to the L-type calcium channel mutation compared to phase 1.

C. Abnormal phase 3 - This would be more likely associated with prolongation of the action potential duration (APD), which could result from various factors including potassium channel dysfunction or other ion channel abnormalities, but it's not as directly linked to the L-type calcium channel mutation as phase 1.

D. Abnormal phase 2 - While repolarization phases are affected in cardiac conditions, an abnormality specifically in phase 2 is less directly related to the L-type calcium channel mutation compared to phase 1.

Therefore, considering the direct impact of the L-type calcium channel mutation on the ventricular action potential, the most likely expected abnormality would be in phase 1.
