## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and current INR of 2.6, which is significantly elevated, it is crucial to correct his coagulopathy promptly to prevent further bleeding complications.

Firstly, let's consider the options:

A. Cryoprecipitate - This is a rich source of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor (vWF), and factor VIII. While it can help with clotting, it is not the most effective choice for correcting coagulopathy in this scenario.

B. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) - FFP contains all clotting factors except for factor VIII. It would be beneficial to correct the patient's INR by replacing the deficient factor VIII, but FFP alone may not provide sufficient correction of the elevated INR.

C. Intravenous vitamin K - Vitamin K is essential for the production of several clotting factors, including II, VII, IX, and X. Administering intravenous vitamin K would help correct the patient's coagulopathy by replenishing these deficient factors, which are necessary for normal blood clotting.

D. Platelets - While platelet transfusion may be considered in certain cases of bleeding, it is not a primary treatment for coagulopathy and would not address the underlying issue of elevated INR.

Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and current INR elevation, correcting his coagulopathy with intravenous vitamin K is the most appropriate next step. This will help restore normal blood clotting factors and prevent further bleeding complications.

Therefore, the answer is C.
