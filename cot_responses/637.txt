## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory results, this patient is likely suffering from acute cholecystitis, which is an inflammation of the gallbladder. The key findings that support this diagnosis include:

1. **Acute onset RUQ pain** after a large meal, which suggests gallbladder dysfunction.
2. **Jaundice**, indicated by the slightly elevated bilirubin levels and jaundiced appearance on physical examination.
3. **Tenderness to palpation in the RUQ with no rebound or guarding**, which is consistent with gallbladder inflammation.
4. **Inspiratory arrest** on deep palpation in the RUQ, suggesting pericholecystic fluid (fluid surrounding the gallbladder) that may be causing obstruction.

The ultrasound findings of a non-dilated common bile duct are also supportive of this diagnosis.

Considering these findings, the most appropriate treatment for acute cholecystitis is:

**B. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy**

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that involves removing the gallbladder through small incisions. It is the standard treatment for acute cholecystitis and has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms, improving quality of life, and preventing future episodes of gallbladder disease.

The other options are not appropriate:

* **A. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)**: While ERCP can be used to diagnose and treat certain conditions related to the bile ducts, it is not the first-line treatment for acute cholecystitis.
* **C. Percutaneous cholecystostomy**: This procedure involves placing a catheter into the gallbladder through the skin to drain fluid. It may be considered in some cases of acute cholecystitis, but it is not as effective as laparoscopic cholecystectomy and carries higher risks.
* **D. Shock wave lithotripsy**: This non-invasive procedure uses shock waves to break up kidney stones or gallstones. It is not applicable to this patient's condition.

Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient with acute cholecystitis is laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
