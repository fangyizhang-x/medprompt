Given the clinical presentation of progressive fatigue and shortness of breath in a 7-year-old boy, particularly during physical activity, it is essential to consider congenital heart diseases that can lead to increased oxygen demand or decreased oxygen supply. The key features here are:

1. **Progressive fatigue and shortness of breath**: These symptoms suggest an issue with cardiac output or oxygen delivery to tissues.
2. **Physical examination findings**:
   - Normal pulse rate and blood pressure, which might initially seem reassuring but can be misleading in the context of potential underlying conditions affecting cardiac function.
   - No radio-femoral delay, which is often associated with left-sided heart defects.

Considering these points:

- **Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)**: ASDs typically present with symptoms related to increased pulmonary blood flow and oxygenation issues. However, they usually do not cause progressive fatigue or shortness of breath during physical activity without other signs like cyanosis or clubbing.
  
- **Coarctation of the Aorta**: This condition involves narrowing of the aortic isthmus, which can lead to hypertension in the arms and decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities. While it can cause fatigue and shortness of breath due to decreased cardiac output, it is less likely to be associated with progressive fatigue during physical activity without other signs.

- **Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defect (AVSD)**: AVSDs are complex congenital heart defects that involve both atrial and ventricular septa. They can lead to increased pulmonary blood flow and oxygenation issues, similar to ASDs. However, they often present with cyanosis or other signs of right-to-left shunting.

- **Double-Outlet Right Ventricle (DORV) with Subaortic Ventricular Septal Defect (SVSD)**: This combination can lead to increased pulmonary blood flow and oxygenation issues due to the right ventricle's inability to pump effectively. It is also associated with cyanosis, which might be more pronounced in DORV.

Given these considerations, **D. Double-outlet right ventricle with subaortic ventricular septal defect** seems the most likely congenital heart disease that would present with progressive fatigue and shortness of breath during physical activity due to increased pulmonary blood flow and oxygenation issues without other signs like cyanosis or clubbing.

The reasoning behind this choice is based on
