## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, including worsening tics and difficulty walking over a 3-year period, along with prominent atrophy of the caudate nucleus on MRI, we can deduce that his condition is likely related to a genetic disorder affecting movement and cognition.

The fact that he has been taking anti-anxiety medications without a prescription and has a history of using online pharmacies suggests that he may have a substance use disorder. However, this does not directly relate to the patient's current symptoms.

The key finding in the MRI is atrophy of the caudate nucleus, which is a region of the brain involved in movement control and cognition. This suggests that the patient's condition is likely related to a genetic mutation affecting the production or function of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, a part of the brain.

The trinucleotide repeats associated with various neurodegenerative disorders include:

- CAG repeats are commonly found in Huntington's disease.
- CTG repeats are typically seen in myotonic dystrophy type 1.
- CGG repeats are often linked to Fragile X syndrome.

Given that the patient has prominent atrophy of the caudate nucleus, which is consistent with a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons, and considering the trinucleotide repeat associated with Fragile X syndrome (CGG), it is reasonable to conclude that the most likely cause of this patient's disorder is Fragile X syndrome.

Therefore, the repeats most likely responsible for this patientâ€™s disorder are D. CTG.
