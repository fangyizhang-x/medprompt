Given the patient's presentation and history, the most likely diagnosis is an allergic reaction to the sheep hyperimmune Fab antivenom he received for his cottonmouth viper bite. The symptoms described, such as a pruritic periumbilical serpiginous macular rash that has spread, are classic for anaphylaxis.

The patient's medical history of allergies (gout, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type II) and skin conditions (multiple basal cell carcinomas on his face and neck) increases the likelihood of an allergic reaction to the antivenom. The presence of diffuse arthralgias also supports this diagnosis.

The patient's current symptoms, including a high fever, tachycardia, and respiratory rate, further support the need for immediate treatment to address potential complications of anaphylaxis, such as bronchospasm or cardiac arrhythmias.

Given these considerations, the next best step in patient management is to initiate treatment with glucocorticoids to help reduce inflammation and prevent further tissue damage. This is because anaphylaxis can lead to severe systemic reactions, including adrenal insufficiency, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.

Antihistamines may provide symptomatic relief but are not sufficient to address the underlying cause of the reaction. NSAIDs may also help with pain and inflammation but do not address the potential for a severe systemic reaction. Plasmapheresis is an invasive procedure that is typically reserved for severe, life-threatening allergic reactions or autoimmune disorders.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in patient management is to initiate glucocorticoid tapering with antihistamines to help manage the symptoms of anaphylaxis and prevent further complications.
