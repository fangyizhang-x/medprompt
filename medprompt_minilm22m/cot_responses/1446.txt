## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation with severe abdominal pain, dilated abdominal aorta on ultrasound, and family history of similar findings, we need to consider the potential causes and risk factors.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option:

A. Atherosclerosis: This is a significant risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), which can lead to severe abdominal pain. However, it is not directly related to the dilated abdominal aorta seen on ultrasound.

B. Caucasian race: While there may be some association between certain ethnicities and AAA, this is not the greatest risk factor in this case.

C. Cigarette smoking: Smoking is a well-established risk factor for AAA, as it damages the inner lining of blood vessels and increases blood pressure, both of which can contribute to aneurysm formation.

D. Family history: While having a family history of AAA may increase the patient's risk, it is not as strong a risk factor as smoking.

Considering these factors, the greatest risk factor for this patient's presentation is cigarette smoking (C). The patient's father died of a similar finding, suggesting a possible genetic component to his condition. Additionally, the patient's own smoking history increases his risk of developing an AAA.

Therefore, the answer is C.
