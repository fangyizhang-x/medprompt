## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, including sudden-onset fever, malaise, pain and swelling of his wrists and ankles, and a history of hypertension treatment with hydralazine, we can deduce that this patient is likely experiencing an acute inflammatory condition. The presence of joint swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema in both wrists and ankles further supports this diagnosis.

The recent initiation of hydralazine for hypertension treatment could be a contributing factor to the development of this condition, as hydralazine can cause vasculitis, particularly in patients with pre-existing conditions such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. However, the specific autoantibody associated with this patient's presentation is more closely related to an autoimmune disease that can present with systemic symptoms and joint involvement.

Among the options provided:

A. Anti-dsDNA - This antibody is typically associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), which can cause a wide range of symptoms including arthritis, but it is not the most likely autoantibody in this scenario given the patient's recent initiation of hydralazine.

B. Anti-Smith - This antibody is also seen in SLE and is highly specific for the disease. However, its presence would be more indicative of an active SLE rather than a new onset condition following medication changes.

C. Anti-Î²2-glycoprotein - This autoantibody can be associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which can cause thrombosis and pregnancy complications. While it is possible, the patient's presentation does not strongly suggest APS.

D. Anti-histone - This antibody is commonly found in drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE), a condition that mimics SLE but is caused by medication exposure. Given the patient's recent initiation of hydralazine for hypertension treatment and the presence of joint symptoms, DILE is the most likely diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's presentation and the association with drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE), the increased level of anti-histone autoantibody would be expected.
