## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is Infectious Mononucleosis (IM), also known as glandular fever or mono. The presence of a diffuse rash, tonsillar enlargement, erythema with exudates, tender cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy, mild splenomegaly, and an elevated leukocyte count are all consistent with IM.

The patient's history of gonorrhea treatment one year ago is also relevant, as IM can be caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. However, the presence of a rash and other symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and sore throat make CMV (Cytomegalovirus) less likely.

Given this information, the next best step in management would be to perform an ELISA for HIV, which is a common screening test used to detect antibodies against HIV. This test can help identify individuals who may have been exposed to HIV or are at risk of infection, but it does not directly diagnose HIV infection itself.

The other options are less relevant to the patient's current presentation:

* Anti-CMV IgM (A) would be more appropriate if CMV were suspected, which is less likely given the patient's symptoms and history.
* Heterophile agglutination test (C) is an older test used for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis, but it is not as sensitive or specific as ELISA for HIV screening.
* Flow cytometry (D) is a more advanced diagnostic tool that can be used to detect specific antibodies against various pathogens, including HIV. However, it is typically reserved for cases where other tests are inconclusive or when further testing is needed.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform an ELISA for HIV as a screening test to identify individuals who may have been exposed to HIV or are at risk of infection.
