## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Increasing blurring of vision in both eyes**: This symptom can be associated with several conditions, including cataracts, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and hypertensive retinopathy.

2. **Difficulty reading due to blurred vision**: This suggests that the patient's visual acuity is decreasing, which could be related to various causes such as AMD, diabetic retinopathy, or cataracts.

3. **Requires a bright light to look at objects**: This finding is particularly suggestive of conditions that affect the retina's ability to respond to light, such as AMD or diabetic retinopathy.

4. **Symptoms began 8 years ago and have gradually worsened over time**: This indicates a progressive condition rather than an acute event.

5. **Hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus**: Both of these conditions are associated with an increased risk of developing certain eye diseases, including diabetic retinopathy.

6. **Medications include glyburide and lisinopril**: Glyburide is a sulfonylurea used to treat type 2 diabetes, which increases the risk of diabetic retinopathy. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor that can also increase the risk of diabetic retinopathy.

7. **An image of her retina, as viewed through fundoscopy is shown**: Although we cannot see the actual image, the description provided suggests that the fundus examination reveals changes consistent with AMD or diabetic retinopathy.

Considering these factors:

- **Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)**: This condition typically presents in older adults and can cause blurring of vision, especially at night. It often affects both eyes and can be exacerbated by bright lights.
- **Diabetic retinopathy**: Given the patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the presence of blurred vision, diabetic retinopathy is a strong consideration.
- **Cystoid macular edema (CME)**: This condition typically presents with sudden onset of severe eye pain, redness, and visual disturbances. It does not typically cause gradual worsening over time or blurring of vision at night.
- **Hypertensive retinopathy**: While this condition can cause changes in the retina, it is less likely to present with progressive symptoms like
