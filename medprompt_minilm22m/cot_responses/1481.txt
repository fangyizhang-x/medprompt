## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and his current symptoms, including frequent feedings, large-volume and greasy stools, scattered wheezes, a distended and tympanic abdomen without tenderness or guarding, we need to consider potential contraindications for routine vaccinations in this patient.

Firstly, let's evaluate option A: Fever of 38.2°C (100.7°F) following previous vaccinations. While fever is a common side effect of many vaccines, it does not necessarily indicate a contraindication for vaccination. In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children with certain medical conditions or who have had recent infections be vaccinated according to their individual risk assessment.

Next, let's consider option B: History of cystic fibrosis. Having a genetic disorder like cystic fibrosis does increase the risk of certain complications from vaccinations, such as anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions. However, this is not an absolute contraindication for vaccination in all cases.

Option C: History of febrile seizures. While febrile seizures are a concern for children who have had previous febrile seizures, they do not necessarily preclude the administration of routine vaccinations. The risk-benefit analysis should be individualized based on the child's specific situation and medical history.

Finally, let's evaluate option D: History of intussusception. Intussusception is a serious condition that requires prompt medical attention. However, it is not typically considered a contraindication for routine vaccinations in children with cystic fibrosis.

Considering these factors, the most significant concern for this patient is his history of frequent feedings and large-volume and greasy stools, which may indicate malabsorption or gastrointestinal issues. While fever following previous vaccinations (option A) might be concerning, it does not necessarily contraindicate vaccination. The other options do not have a clear contraindication for routine vaccinations in this patient.

Therefore, the answer is A.
