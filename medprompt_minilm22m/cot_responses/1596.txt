## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine the expected pressure readings at the end of inspiration, we need to consider how breathing affects intrathoracic pressure and subsequently the pressures measured by probes A and B.

During normal respiration, the diaphragm descends slightly during inspiration, increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity. This increase in thoracic volume reduces the pressure inside the lungs relative to atmospheric pressure (P0). Conversely, the intercostal muscles contract, which decreases the volume of the thoracic cavity and increases the pressure inside the lungs relative to P0.

Given that Probe A is placed between the parietal and visceral pleura, it measures intrathoracic pressure. As a result, during inspiration:

- The increase in thoracic volume will decrease the pressure measured by Probe A.
- The decrease in thoracic volume due to intercostal muscle contraction will increase the pressure measured by Probe B.

Therefore, considering these physiological changes, the expected pressure readings at the end of inspiration would be:

Probe A: -6 mm Hg (decrease due to increased thoracic volume)
Probe B: 0 mm Hg (increase due to decreased thoracic volume)

The correct answer is C. Probe A: -6 mm Hg; Probe B: 0 mm Hg
