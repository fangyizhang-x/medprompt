## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To answer this question, we need to understand the relative conduction speeds through different parts of the heart.

1. **Purkinje fibers**: These are specialized cardiac muscle cells that transmit electrical signals from the atrioventricular (AV) node to the ventricles, causing them to contract. They have the fastest conduction speed in the heart, typically around 2-3 meters per second (m/s).

2. **Atria**: The atrial chambers receive blood and oxygenated blood from the lungs. While they do receive electrical signals, their conduction speed is slower compared to Purkinje fibers due to the presence of the AV node.

3. **AV node**: This is a specialized cardiac structure that acts as a delay between the electrical signal from the atria and the ventricles. It has a relatively slow conduction speed, typically around 0.5-1 m/s.

4. **Ventricles**: The ventricular chambers contract to pump blood out of the heart. Their conduction speed is slower compared to Purkinje fibers due to the presence of the bundle branches and the His-Purkinje system.

Given this information, we can conclude that the relative conduction speeds from fastest to slowest are:

- Atria > Purkinje fibers > ventricles > AV node

Therefore, the correct answer is:
