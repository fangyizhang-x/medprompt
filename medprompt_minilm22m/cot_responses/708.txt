(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, which includes symptoms of anxiety (mildly anxious patient), irritability, difficulty sleeping, and a history of depression, as well as her recent worsening worry-a-holic tendencies with an impending deadline for a final paper, it is essential to consider effective treatments that address these symptoms.

First, let's evaluate the options:

A. Buspirone: This is an anxiolytic medication primarily used for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). While it can help alleviate anxiety symptoms, buspirone may not be sufficient as a first-line treatment given its potential side effects and lower efficacy compared to other options.

B. Bupropion: This is an antidepressant that also has anxiolytic properties. However, bupropion is primarily used for major depressive disorder (MDD) and seasonal affective disorder (SAD), not typically as a first-line treatment for anxiety disorders like GAD or panic disorder.

C. Desensitization therapy: This is a type of psychotherapy that involves gradually exposing the patient to the feared object, situation, or activity in a controlled manner. While effective for some anxiety disorders, desensitization may not be the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient's condition, given her recent worsening symptoms and lack of prior exposure to the feared stimuli.

D. Relaxation training: This is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on teaching patients relaxation techniques to manage stress and anxiety. Given the patient's history of depression and current symptoms of worry-a-holism, as well as her recent deadline for a final paper, relaxation training could be an effective treatment approach. It addresses the underlying issues contributing to her anxiety and can help her develop coping skills to manage her symptoms.

Considering these factors, relaxation training appears to be the most appropriate initial treatment option for this patient's condition, given its focus on addressing anxiety and stress, as well as its potential benefits in managing symptoms of depression.

The final answer is: D
