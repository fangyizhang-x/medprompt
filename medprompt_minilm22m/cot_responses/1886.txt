## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, including an intermittent rash on his feet associated with itching and burning, diffuse erythema, maceration of the interdigital spaces between his toes, and subsequent severe nausea and vomiting after drinking alcohol, we can deduce that the medication prescribed likely contains antifungal properties.

The presence of a rash, particularly in the interdigital spaces, is highly suggestive of fungal infections such as athlete's foot. The fact that the patient has been working in wet conditions and hasn't had time to dry his feet properly increases the risk of fungal infections.

Considering the symptoms and the context, we can narrow down the possible causes:

- The rash and itching are consistent with a fungal infection.
- The diffuse erythema and maceration of the interdigital spaces suggest severe inflammation, which is also characteristic of fungal infections.
- The patient's recent history of taking medication for an unspecified condition (implied by "starts taking a medication") could be related to the underlying cause of his symptoms.

Given these points, we can now consider the possible mechanisms of action:

A. Cell arrest at metaphase - This is the mechanism of action for drugs that inhibit microtubule polymerization, such as taxanes used in cancer treatment. It's unlikely to be relevant here.
B. Disruption of fungal cell membrane - This is a plausible mechanism of action for antifungal medications. Many antifungals work by disrupting the fungal cell membrane, preventing the entry of nutrients and toxins into the cell.
C. Inhibition of cell wall synthesis - This is the mechanism of action for antibiotics that target bacterial cell walls, such as penicillins and cephalosporins. It's unlikely to be relevant here.
D. Inhibition of DNA synthesis - This is the mechanism of action for antineoplastic agents that interfere with DNA replication, such as chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin. While some antifungals may have this mechanism, it's less likely given the context.

Based on the patient's symptoms and the likely cause being a fungal infection, the most plausible mechanism of action is disruption of the fungal cell membrane.

The final answer is: B
