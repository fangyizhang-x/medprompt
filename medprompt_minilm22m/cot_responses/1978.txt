To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the findings from the anoscopy.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with bloody stools (hematochezia) and a feeling of a mass near her anus. These symptoms suggest a possible gastrointestinal source for the bleeding.
2. **History**: She has a history of alcohol abuse, which can lead to various gastrointestinal issues, including hemorrhoids. However, the presence of a mass near the anus suggests that the issue might be more localized than just hemorrhoids.
3. **Anoscopy findings**: Engorged vessels are observed on anoscopy. This finding is crucial as it indicates that there is likely increased blood flow or pressure in the affected area.

Given these points, let's consider the possible sources of bleeding:

- **Superior rectal vein (A)**: While this vein can be involved in hemorrhoids, it's less likely to cause a mass near the anus.
- **Inferior rectal vein (B)**: This vein is more proximal and drains into the inferior mesenteric vein. It's not typically associated with masses or significant bleeding at the base of the anal canal.
- **Middle rectal vein (C)**: The middle rectal vein is a major vessel that drains blood from the rectum, including the area near the anus. Its engorged state on anoscopy could indicate increased pressure or congestion in this region, which might be causing the bleeding and mass sensation.
- **Left colic vein (D)**: This vein primarily drains into the inferior mesenteric vein and is less likely to cause a localized mass effect.

Considering these factors, the most likely vessel that drains blood from the affected region is the middle rectal vein. This conclusion is based on the patient's symptoms of bloody stools and a feeling of a mass near her anus, which are consistent with a possible hemorrhoid or other rectal pathology affecting the middle rectal area.

The final answer is: C
