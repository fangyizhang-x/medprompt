## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history of carotid artery stenosis, particularly with a significant left internal carotid artery stenosis (50% stenosis), we can infer that his current symptoms are likely related to reduced blood flow through the right internal carotid artery. The patient's wife reports a recent episode of painless visual loss in his left eye, which is consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a stroke.

The key factor here is the significant stenosis of the right internal carotid artery, which is likely to cause reduced blood flow through this artery. The patient's symptoms, including rapid onset right-sided weakness and decreased sensation on the right side of his body, are consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a stroke.

The expected change in resistance to blood flow through the stenotic artery most likely responsible for this patientâ€™s current symptoms is an increase. This is because the increased resistance will lead to a decrease in blood flow through the stenotic artery, resulting in reduced oxygen delivery to the brain and potentially leading to ischemic damage or infarction.

The options provided can be evaluated as follows:

A. It will be 4 times greater - This option suggests an increase in resistance, which is consistent with the expected outcome of increased blood flow through a stenotic artery.

B. It will be 8 times greater - While this option also suggests an increase in resistance, it is not supported by the information provided and would likely result in excessive blood pressure readings.

C. It will be 16 times greater - This option suggests an even greater increase in resistance than option A, which is unlikely given the patient's current symptoms and the expected outcome of increased blood flow through a stenotic artery.

D. No change - Given the significant stenosis of the right internal carotid artery, it is unlikely that there will be no change in resistance to blood flow through this artery.

Therefore, based on the analysis above, the most likely answer is:
