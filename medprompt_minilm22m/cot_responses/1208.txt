Given the symptoms described, including repetitive involuntary movements such as neck twisting, grimacing, grunting, and blinking, which worsen with fatigue and improve with concentration, along with excessive anxiety about these movements, this condition is most likely Tourette Syndrome (TS). TS is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by chronic motor and vocal tics that are present at least six months before the age of 18.

The presence of excessive anxiety about the tics also supports this diagnosis. The fact that the symptoms have worsened with fatigue suggests that they may be related to stress or emotional states, which is consistent with TS.

For pharmacotherapy in children and adolescents with Tourette Syndrome, the first-line treatment typically involves a combination of medications aimed at reducing the frequency and severity of tics. Among these options, Risperidone (B) has been widely recognized as an effective medication for treating both motor and vocal tics in individuals with TS.

Alprazolam (A), while sometimes used to treat anxiety, is not typically considered a first-line treatment for Tourette Syndrome due to its potential for dependence and the availability of more targeted treatments. Chlorpromazine (D) is also an antipsychotic that can be used to treat tics but is generally reserved for cases where other medications have failed or are contraindicated.

Fluoxetine (C), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is primarily used as an antidepressant and has not been established as a first-line treatment for Tourette Syndrome. While it may have some benefits in reducing anxiety associated with tics, its use would need to be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for this condition appears to be Risperidone (B).
