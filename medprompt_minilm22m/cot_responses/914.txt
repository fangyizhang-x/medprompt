## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The key points from the scenario that guide our reasoning are:

1. The patient presents with intermittent and severe periumbilical pain, which is a common symptom associated with appendicitis.
2. The physical examination reveals mild tenderness around the umbilicus without distension or discharge, which further supports the diagnosis of appendicitis.
3. The abdominal imaging shows enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, which can be seen in cases of appendicitis due to the inflammatory process affecting the surrounding tissues and lymphatic vessels.

Given these points, we need to consider what is known about the relationship between appendicitis and renal anomalies.

- Option A: Fused kidneys ascend beyond superior mesenteric artery. This option describes a condition where the kidneys fuse together, which can be associated with various conditions including congenital anomalies or as a result of surgical interventions like nephrectomy. However, it is not directly related to the scenario described.
  
- Option B: Increased risk of developing renal vein thrombosis. While there are several factors that increase the risk of renal vein thrombosis, this option does not specifically relate to the scenario presented.

- Option C: Association with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO). UPJO is a condition where the ureters become blocked at the junction between the kidney and the pelvis. This can lead to various complications including hydronephrosis and renal failure. However, it is not directly related to the scenario described.

- Option D: Kidneys are usually non-functional. The question asks for a description of a renal anomaly that was "incidentally" seen during the imaging of the patient with mesenteric lymphadenitis. Given the context, this option suggests that the kidneys may have been affected in some way, even if they were not directly involved in the initial presentation.

Considering these points, the most appropriate answer is D. Kidneys are usually non-functional. This option acknowledges that while the kidneys themselves may not be significantly affected by mesenteric lymphadenitis (as suggested by the lack of significant past medical history), there could still be some degree of renal involvement or dysfunction due to the inflammatory process affecting surrounding tissues and potentially leading to scarring or fibrosis.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
