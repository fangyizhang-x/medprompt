## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the scenario, we need to consider the most likely substance that could cause conjunctival injection and combative behavior in a 20-year-old college student after a motor vehicle accident. The presence of injected conjunctiva suggests the use of a local anesthetic or other substances that can cause such effects.

Option B, Urine immunoassay, is a screening test for detecting illicit substances in urine. While it can detect some substances, it may not be sensitive enough to confirm the presence of a specific substance, especially if the amount is low or if the substance is metabolized quickly.

Option C, Western blot, is a more specific laboratory test used to detect and quantify proteins in biological samples. It's typically used for diagnosing infections, autoimmune diseases, or certain types of cancer. While it could potentially be used to identify substances, it's not the most practical choice for this scenario due to its complexity and cost.

Option D, Gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS), is a highly sensitive and specific analytical technique that can accurately detect and quantify a wide range of substances in biological samples. It's particularly useful for identifying illicit substances, such as opioids or benzodiazepines, which are commonly abused after motor vehicle accidents.

Given the information provided, the most likely test to confirm potential substance use is Gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS), as it offers high sensitivity and specificity for detecting a wide range of substances. This would be particularly useful in this scenario if the patient's conjunctiva injection was caused by an illicit substance.

## Answer Explanation:
The presence of injected conjunctiva suggests the use of a local anesthetic or other substances that can cause such effects. While urine immunoassay (Option B) could detect some substances, it may not be sensitive enough to confirm the presence of a specific substance. Western blot (Option C) is more complex and typically used for diagnosing infections or autoimmune diseases. Gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS) (Option D) is highly sensitive and specific for detecting a wide range of substances, making it the most likely test to confirm potential substance use in this scenario.
