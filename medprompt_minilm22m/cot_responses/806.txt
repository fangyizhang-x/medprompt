Given the patient's presentation with severe, whole-body itching, episodes of joint swelling and pain in her hands, redness, burning pain, and swelling of her hands and feet, along with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we need to consider an underlying condition that could be contributing to these symptoms.

The laboratory tests provided show mild electrolyte imbalances (elevated sodium, chloride, and potassium levels) but no significant abnormalities in the glucose, creatinine, or hematocrit. The leukocyte count is within normal limits, which suggests that there may not be an acute infection or inflammatory process at play.

Considering the patient's history of DVT, we should think about conditions that could increase the risk of thrombosis or contribute to her symptoms. One possibility is a condition known as Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP), which is characterized by the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, leading to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure.

Given this potential diagnosis, we should consider medications that can help manage TTP. Among the options provided:

- Diphenhydramine (A) is an antihistamine that may be used for itching but does not have a direct role in managing TTP.
- Hydroxyurea (B) is an immunosuppressive agent that has been shown to be effective in treating TTP by reducing the formation of blood clots and improving hemoglobin levels. It is often considered as a first-line treatment for TTP.
- Febuxostat (C) is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor used primarily to treat gout, not TTP.
- Prednisone (D) is a corticosteroid that may be used in some cases of TTP but is not the most effective or commonly recommended initial treatment.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms and history, the best next step in treatment would be to initiate Hydroxyurea (B) as an immunosuppressive agent to help manage her condition.
