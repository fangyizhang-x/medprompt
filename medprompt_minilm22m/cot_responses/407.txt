The correct answer can be determined by understanding the legal and ethical implications of a patient's incapacity to make medical decisions.

Firstly, it is essential to recognize that a patient who has undergone splenectomy (removal of their spleen) and has a subdural hematoma (a type of brain injury) requires life support. This situation implies that the patient is unable to provide informed consent for medical treatment due to their physical condition.

The legal framework in many jurisdictions provides for alternative decision-making authority in cases where a patient lacks capacity. The most common alternatives are:

1.  **Living Will**: A document that outlines a person's wishes regarding life-sustaining treatments, such as organ donation or withdrawal of life support.
2.  **Durable Power of Attorney (DPOA)**: An instrument that grants someone the authority to make decisions on behalf of another person who lacks capacity. In this case, the patient would not have a DPOA because they are incapacitated and unable to grant one.
3.  **Spouse or Next of Kin**: The spouse or next of kin (e.g., parents, siblings) can be designated as the alternate decision-maker in the event that the patient lacks capacity.

Given these alternatives, it is clear that the spouse would be responsible for making medical decisions for the incapacitated patient.

The family members mentioned (older sibling, parents, siblings, and grandparents) are not typically considered alternative decision-makers in this scenario. While they may have a role in supporting the patient's loved ones, they do not possess the authority to make medical decisions on behalf of the patient.

Therefore, the answer is D.
