## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Firstly, let's analyze the given information about the child's physical and developmental characteristics:

- The child is at the 75th percentile for head circumference, indicating that she has a normal size for her age.
- She is at the 80th percentile for length and weight, suggesting that she is above average in terms of height and weight for her age.
- She can lift her chest and shoulders up when in a prone position but cannot roll over from a prone position. This indicates that she has some level of upper body strength but may have difficulty with rolling over due to muscle tone or other factors.
- Her eyes follow objects past the midline, which is an indicator of good eye coordination and visual tracking abilities.
- She coos and makes gurgling sounds, suggesting normal communication skills.
- When the investigator strokes the sole of her foot, her big toe curls upward and there is fanning of her other toes. This behavior is indicative of a Babinski reflex, which is present in infants but typically disappears by 12 months of age.
- She makes a stepping motion when held upright and her feet are in contact with the examination table, indicating good motor control and coordination.

Given these observations, it's essential to consider what skills or behaviors would be expected in a healthy infant of this developmental age. Typically, infants at this stage should have developed sufficient strength, coordination, and communication skills to perform tasks like lifting their heads while in a prone position, rolling over from a prone position, following objects past the midline, cooing and making gurgling sounds, and having a Babinski reflex.

In contrast, the child's inability to roll over from a prone position suggests that she may have some level of neurological or muscular development delay. The absence of rolling over also raises concerns about her overall motor control and coordination.

Considering these factors, it's unlikely that the child would exhibit behaviors such as reaching out for objects (A), responding to calling of own name (B), crying when separated from her mother (C), or smiling at her mother (D) in a healthy infant of this developmental age. These behaviors are more characteristic of older infants and toddlers who have developed sufficient cognitive, motor, and social skills.

Therefore, the expected additional skill or behavior in a healthy patient of this developmental age would be to make a stepping motion when held upright and her feet are in contact with the examination table (D).
