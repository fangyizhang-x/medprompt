## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of vaginal bleeding, lower right abdominal pain increasing in intensity, localized right adnexal tenderness on examination, and the ultrasound confirmation of a 2.0 cm gestational sac in the right fallopian tube, the most likely diagnosis is ectopic pregnancy.

The patient's history of chronic hepatitis C infection is relevant because it increases the risk for certain complications during pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancy. The fact that she takes a pill for her condition 'every now and then' suggests that she may be taking anticonvulsants or other medications that could potentially affect the timing of ovulation.

The presence of localized right adnexal tenderness on examination is highly suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy, which requires urgent surgical intervention to prevent further complications. The absence of rebound tenderness or guarding does not rule out an ectopic pregnancy, as some women with ectopic pregnancies may not have significant abdominal pain.

Given the ultrasound confirmation of a gestational sac in the right fallopian tube, the next appropriate step is to confirm the diagnosis through further imaging and then proceed with surgical intervention. This may involve:

1. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) to evaluate the location and size of the ectopic pregnancy.
2. A hysteroscopy to visualize the inside of the uterus and assess for any abnormalities.

IV fluids, while important in managing the patient's hydration status, are not the next appropriate step in the management of an ectopic pregnancy. Surgery is the definitive treatment for ectopic pregnancy, and IV fluids can be administered after surgery to prevent complications such as hemorrhage.

Methotrexate (C) would not be appropriate as a first-line treatment for ectopic pregnancy, although it may be considered in certain cases where surgical intervention is contraindicated or not feasible. Tubal ligation (D) is not an appropriate management option for ectopic pregnancy and would not address the underlying cause of her symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. IV fluids, then surgery.
