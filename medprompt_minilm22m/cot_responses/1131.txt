To approach this question, we need to understand the relationship between diabetes medications and their effects on C-peptide levels.

Firstly, let's clarify what C-peptide is: it's a peptide fragment that is co-secreted with insulin from the pancreas. Therefore, when we talk about increasing C-peptide levels, we're essentially talking about increasing insulin levels in the blood.

Now, let's examine each option:

A. Insulin - This is the correct answer. Insulin is a direct precursor to C-peptide. When administered as part of an insulin regimen, it will increase the levels of both insulin and C-peptide in the blood.

B. Glipizide - This is a sulfonylurea used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by stimulating insulin release from the pancreas, but it does not directly affect C-peptide levels.

C. Acarbose - This is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that delays carbohydrate absorption and increases insulin sensitivity. Like Glipizide, it doesn't directly increase C-peptide levels.

D. NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) - This is a long-acting insulin analog used to treat type 1 diabetes or as part of an insulin regimen for type 2 diabetes. While it does contain insulin, its primary action is not to increase C-peptide levels.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Insulin, as it directly increases C-peptide levels when administered to this patient.
