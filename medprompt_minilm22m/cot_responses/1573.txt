## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history of anabolic steroid use, which is a known risk factor for liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), we should consider this when evaluating the likely histopathologic finding.

The patient's presentation of a 4-week history of dull abdominal pain located in the right upper quadrant without change with eating and no palpable mass or tenderness on exam, combined with his history of anabolic steroid use, raises suspicion for hepatocellular carcinoma. The enhancing liver nodule on imaging further supports this diagnosis.

The options provided can be evaluated as follows:

A. Columnar cells with acinar structures - This description is more typical of adenocarcinoma, which is less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

B. Hypervascular lesion lined by normal endothelial cells - This option describes a vascular malformation or hemangioma, which does not align with the enhancing liver nodule seen on imaging.

C. Multifocal tumor with multiple layers of hepatocytes with hemorrhage and necrosis - While this description could potentially fit several types of liver lesions, it is less specific to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than option D.

D. Sheets of normal hepatocytes without portal tracts or central veins - This description is classic for hepatocellular carcinoma, as HCC typically presents with a well-circumscribed nodule composed of sheets of uniform hepatocytes without the characteristic portal tract or central vein formation seen in other liver lesions.

Therefore, based on the patient's history and presentation, the most likely histopathologic finding of this patientâ€™s disease is hepatocellular carcinoma.
