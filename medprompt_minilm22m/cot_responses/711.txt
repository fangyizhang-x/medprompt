## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation and history, we can deduce that she likely has placenta previa, a condition characterized by placental implantation in or near the internal cervical os.

Firstly, let's consider option A - Intake of oral contraceptives. While oral contraceptive use is associated with an increased risk of placenta previa, particularly in women who have had previous uterine surgery (such as a cesarean section), it is not the most direct risk factor for this patient.

Option B - Nulliparity. This is indeed a significant risk factor for placenta previa. Women who have never given birth (nulliparous) are more likely to develop placenta previa, especially if they have had previous uterine surgery or other factors that increase the risk of placental implantation in the uterus.

Option C - Smoking. While smoking is a significant risk factor for many pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia and gestational diabetes, it is not as directly linked to placenta previa as nulliparity.

Option D - White race. While racial or ethnic background can influence various aspects of pregnancy outcomes, such as gestational diabetes and preterm labor, it is not a direct risk factor for placenta previa.

Given the patient's history of previous uterine surgery (cervical polypectomy) and nulliparity, the most significant risk factor for her condition appears to be nulliparity. This is because women who have never given birth are more likely to develop placenta previa, especially if they have had previous uterine surgery or other factors that increase the risk of placental implantation in the uterus.

Therefore, the answer is B.
