## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, let's break down the key points:

1. **Age and Sex**: A 23-year-old woman is a young individual who could be experiencing various musculoskeletal issues due to her age and sex.
2. **Symptoms**: The patient reports knee pain that started yesterday and has been worsening steadily over the past few days, particularly with repetitive pivoting and twisting movements while playing volleyball.
3. **Past Medical History**: She has a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and is currently taking oral contraceptive pills. This information is relevant because PCOS can increase the risk for certain musculoskeletal issues, such as ligament laxity or bursitis.
4. **Physical Examination Findings**:
   - Tenderness over the medial aspect of the tibia just inferior to the patella upon palpation.
   - Obesity with facial hair, which might indicate insulin resistance or other metabolic changes associated with PCOS.
5. **BMI**: A BMI of 37 kg/m^2 is classified as obese, which increases the risk for various musculoskeletal issues, including bursitis and ligamentous laxity.

Considering these points:

- **Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) Tear (A)**: While a MCL tear could cause knee pain, it typically presents with a more acute onset of pain following a specific traumatic event or significant stress on the knee. The patient's symptoms started after she began playing volleyball, which might not be directly related to the initial injury.
- **Medial Meniscus Tear (B)**: A meniscus tear can cause knee pain and swelling but is less likely given the patient's recent onset of symptoms and the specific location of tenderness over the medial aspect of the tibia.
- **Patellofemoral Syndrome (C)**: This condition involves pain around or behind the patella, which might not be directly related to the tenderness over the medial aspect of the tibia.
- **Pes Anserine Bursitis (D)**: Given the patient's obesity and symptoms of tenderness over the medial aspect of the tibia just inferior to the patella, pes anserine bursitis is a highly likely diagnosis. This condition often occurs in obese individuals due to increased pressure on the bursa, which can become inflamed.

The most likely diagnosis is **D. Pes Anser
