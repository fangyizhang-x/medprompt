## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Firstly, let's analyze the situation: The patient has undergone a surgical intervention for a right upper quadrant stab wound with a lacerated gallbladder removed.

The histological evaluation of the removed gallbladder is crucial to understand its structure and function. Given that the gallbladder was surgically removed, we can infer that it is no longer functioning as an organ.

Now, let's examine each option:

A. The cells in area 1 are likely hepatocytes, which are the main cell type of the liver. They play a crucial role in bile production and secretion. Therefore, statement A is incorrect because the function of the cells in area 1 is not to secrete bile.

B. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that stimulates the release of digestive enzymes from the pancreas and gallbladder. However, it does not directly inactivate cells in the gallbladder. Instead, CCK is involved in regulating the contraction and relaxation of the gallbladder muscle. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.

C. This section is indeed taken from a location that does not adjoin the liver. The gallbladder is located under the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, away from the liver. Therefore, statement C is correct.

D. Normally, there should be goblet cells among the cells in area 1 because goblet cells are responsible for producing mucus, which helps to lubricate and protect the digestive tract. However, in a removed gallbladder, the presence of goblet cells would indicate that the gallbladder was once functioning as an organ with a mucosal lining. Therefore, statement D is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
