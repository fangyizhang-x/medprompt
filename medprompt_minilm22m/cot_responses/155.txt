## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the symptoms described, including tingling sensations in the fingertips and skin around the mouth, muscle spasms, and a high blood pressure reading, this patient is likely experiencing hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) due to the recent thyroidectomy. The postoperative period can be particularly challenging for patients with hypoparathyroidism or those who have undergone surgery that affects parathyroid hormone (PTH) production.

The symptoms of tingling sensations in the fingertips and skin around the mouth are classic for tetany, which is often associated with hypocalcemia. Muscle spasms could also be related to hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels), but given the context of recent surgery and the presence of tetany, it's more likely that we're dealing with a hypocalcemic crisis.

Propylthiouracil (A) is an antithyroid medication used to treat hyperthyroidism, not hypothyroidism. Magnesium replacement (B) might be considered in some cases of hypocalcemia, but it's not the immediate next step given the context of tetany and potential for hypercalcemia.

Albumin infusion (C) is a treatment option for hypoproteinemia or hypoalbuminemia, which can occur postoperatively due to blood loss or other factors. However, it does not address the underlying issue of hypocalcemia.

Calcium replacement (D) is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's symptoms. Calcium supplements are often given to treat hypocalcemia and prevent further complications such as tetany, muscle cramps, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.
