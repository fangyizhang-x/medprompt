## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can approach this question by considering the possible causes of a diastolic decrescendo blowing murmur radiating along the left sternal border.

Firstly, let's consider the patient's age and history. The patient is 32 years old and has not seen a doctor in 10 years, which raises concerns about his overall health and potential underlying conditions that may have been missed or misdiagnosed over time.

The physical examination finding of an early diastolic decrescendo blowing murmur radiating along the left sternal border is highly suggestive of aortic regurgitation (AR). This type of murmur is characterized by a continuous, low-pitched sound that decreases in intensity with respiration and increases with exercise. The fact that it radiates along the left sternal border also points towards aortic regurgitation.

Now, let's consider the possible causes of AR:

A. Syphilis: While syphilis can cause various cardiovascular abnormalities, including aortic regurgitation, it is not the most common cause in this age group.

B. Connective tissue disease: Connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus can cause aortic regurgitation, but they are less likely to be associated with this specific physical examination finding.

C. Myxomatous degeneration: This condition is more commonly associated with mitral valve prolapse rather than aortic regurgitation.

D. Congenital bicuspid aortic valve: This is the most common cause of aortic regurgitation in adults, particularly those who have not undergone surgical correction for their congenital heart defect. The patient's age and lack of previous medical history make this option highly plausible.

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely cause of his condition is congenital bicuspid aortic valve (D). This condition can lead to aortic regurgitation over time due to the abnormal valve structure and function. Surgical correction may be necessary in some cases, but it is not typically performed until later in life.

Therefore, the answer is D.
