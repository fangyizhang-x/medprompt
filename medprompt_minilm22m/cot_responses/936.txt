Given the patient's presentation of sudden onset severe eye pain, blurred vision, and tearing after a traumatic event (drilling metal beams), along with his medical history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus, it is essential to consider the possibility of an orbital or retro-orbital hemorrhage. The absence of obvious lacerations or defects in extraocular movements and the presence of conjunctival injection without any other signs of inflammation or infection make a subconjunctival hemorrhage less likely.

The patient's refusal to participate in the visual acuity exam of the right eye due to pain is also an important consideration. This suggests that the examination should be performed with minimal discomfort, which may indicate a more serious condition such as an orbital hematoma.

Considering these factors, the best initial step in management would be to perform a **Tonometry** (C). Tonometry measures intraocular pressure (IOP), which can help identify any potential issues related to glaucoma or other conditions that may cause increased IOP. An elevated IOP is a known risk factor for developing an orbital hematoma, particularly after trauma.

A tonometer will also provide valuable information about the patient's ocular surface and can help rule out other causes of eye pain and vision disturbances, such as corneal ulcers or conjunctivitis.

The other options are not the best initial step in management:

- **Fluorescein stain** (A) may be useful for diagnosing conditions like dry eye syndrome or certain types of conjunctival inflammation, but it is not the most appropriate initial test given the patient's presentation.
- **Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** (B) may be necessary to evaluate for more serious conditions such as an orbital hematoma or other structural abnormalities, but it should not be performed without a thorough medical history and physical examination first.
- **Topical corticosteroids** (D) may be considered if there is evidence of inflammation or infection in the eye, but they are not the best initial step in management given the patient's presentation.

Therefore, tonometry is the most appropriate initial test to evaluate for potential issues related to increased IOP and to rule out other causes of eye pain and vision disturbances.
