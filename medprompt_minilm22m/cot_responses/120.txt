Given the patient's symptoms and findings, including a persistent cough with hemoptysis (coughing up blood), weight loss despite an unchanged appetite, drenching in sweat, and a central nodule on the chest X-ray, we can deduce that this patient likely has lung cancer.

The presence of a central nodule in the hilar region is highly suggestive of lung adenocarcinoma, which is one of the most common types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The fact that she has been experiencing hemoptysis and weight loss for several months suggests that the tumor may be growing and causing significant symptoms.

The patient's smoking history is also a risk factor for lung cancer. Given her age, persistent cough with hemoptysis, and other symptoms, it is essential to investigate further to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease.

Mediastinoscopy (B) would be an excellent next step in management as it allows for direct visualization of the mediastinum, which includes the lymph nodes and airways. This procedure can help identify any metastatic lesions or other abnormalities that may require further treatment.

Chemotherapy (A) is typically considered after a diagnosis of lung cancer has been established, but it would not be the immediate next step in this case given the patient's symptoms and findings.

Radiotherapy (C) might be considered as an adjuvant treatment to reduce the risk of recurrence or metastasis, but it would not address the current symptoms and findings.

Repeat surveillance after 6 months (D) is not sufficient given the patient's symptoms and findings. The presence of a central nodule on the chest X-ray requires further investigation to determine if the tumor has grown or spread.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is mediastinoscopy to investigate the mediastinum and gather more information about the extent of the disease.
