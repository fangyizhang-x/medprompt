## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, let's break down the key points:

1. **Patient Profile**: A 57-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
2. **Symptoms and History**: Weight gain (5 kg or 11 lbs) over the past 6 months, non-adherence to her medication regimen, specifically missing doses of metformin.
3. **Lab Results**: Elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 9.8%.

Considering these points:

- The patient's weight gain and non-adherence to medication are significant concerns that need attention. Weight gain can be a result of poor adherence, insulin resistance, or other factors.
- The elevated HbA1c level indicates poorly controlled diabetes, which increases the risk of complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, and nerve damage.

Given these considerations:

- **Option A (Refer the patient to a dietician)**: While dietary counseling can be beneficial for managing weight and improving insulin sensitivity, it may not address the underlying issues with medication adherence or the elevated HbA1c level.
- **Option B (Schedule more frequent follow-up visits)**: This is a reasonable approach as it allows for closer monitoring of the patient's condition. However, given the patient's non-adherence to her medication regimen and weight gain, this may not be sufficient on its own.
- **Option C (Refer the patient to an endocrinologist)**: An endocrinologist specializes in hormone-related disorders, including diabetes. Given the patient's symptoms and lab results, referring her to an endocrinologist could provide a comprehensive evaluation and potential treatment adjustments.
- **Option D (Add glyburide to the medication regimen)**: Adding a new medication without addressing the underlying issues of non-adherence and weight gain may not be the most effective approach.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate course of action would be to refer the patient to an endocrinologist for a comprehensive evaluation and potential treatment adjustments. This allows for a thorough assessment of the patient's condition, including her medication regimen, lifestyle factors, and any underlying hormonal imbalances that may be contributing to her diabetes management issues.

Therefore, the answer is C.
