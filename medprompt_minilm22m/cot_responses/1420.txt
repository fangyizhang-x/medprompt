## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation and histopathological findings from the FNAC of the nodule, we can deduce the following:

1. **Location and Presentation**: The thyroid mass is located in the right thyroid lobe, which is a common site for follicular neoplasms.
2. **Ultrasound Findings**: The presence of punctate microcalcifications, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and enhanced vascularity on ultrasound supports the diagnosis of a follicular neoplasm.
3. **FNAC Results**: The FNAC shows abundant follicular cells suspicious of follicular neoplasm, which is consistent with the clinical presentation and ultrasound findings.

Considering these points, we can evaluate the options:

A. **Presence of Psammoma bodies**: Psammoma bodies are characteristic of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), not follicular neoplasms. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

B. **Well-differentiated follicular cells without vascular invasion**: While well-differentiated follicular cells are consistent with the FNAC results, vascular invasion is not a diagnostic criterion for follicular neoplasms. This option does not address the key histopathological feature of follicular neoplasms.

C. **Follicular cells that lack nuclear atypia, with capsular and vascular invasion**: This option accurately describes the histopathological features of follicular neoplasms, including well-differentiated follicular adenomas (which are typically non-invasive) and follicular carcinomas (which can be invasive). The presence of capsular and vascular invasion is a key feature that distinguishes follicular neoplasms from other thyroid lesions.

D. **Hyperplastic parafollicular C cells**: Hyperplastic parafollicular C cells are characteristic of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), not follicular neoplasms. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Based on the analysis above, the correct answer is:

## Answer
(C) Follicular cells that lack nuclear atypia, with capsular and vascular invasion
