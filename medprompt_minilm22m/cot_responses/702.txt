## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's first understand the context and the treatment initiated by the physician.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 58-year-old woman with symptoms of difficulty walking, clumsiness, slurred speech, masked facies, and a slow, shuffling gait. These symptoms are suggestive of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is characterized by motor symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and postural instability.

2. **Treatment Initiated**: The physician starts the patient on a combination of levodopa and carbidopa. Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine, which is the neurotransmitter that is deficient in PD due to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Carbidopa is a decarboxylase inhibitor that prevents levodopa from being converted into dopamine outside the brain.

3. **Potential Adverse Drug Effects (ADEs)**: The question asks about the potential ADEs associated with carbidopa, which are:
   - Resting tremor
   - Orthostatic hypotension
   - Visual hallucinations
   - Dyskinesia

4. **Carbidopa's Mechanism of Action**: Carbidopa works by inhibiting the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, thereby increasing the amount of levodopa that reaches the brain where it is needed. This increase in levodopa levels can help alleviate symptoms of PD.

5. **Decreasing Dyskinesia Risk**: The key point here is understanding how carbidopa affects the risk of dyskinesia (a type of involuntary movement disorder) in patients with Parkinson's disease. Carbidopa does not directly affect dopamine receptors or the dopaminergic system, which are the primary targets for levodopa in treating PD.

6. **Conclusion**: Given that carbidopa increases the amount of levodopa available to cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the brain where it is needed, it decreases the risk of dyskinesia by ensuring a more effective treatment of Parkinson's disease symptoms.

Therefore, the answer is D.
