## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's sudden onset of vision loss in one eye, followed by painless episodes that resolve within a minute, this presentation is highly suggestive of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or amaurosis fugax. These conditions are often associated with carotid artery stenosis or occlusion.

The best next step in management for this patient would be to check serum inflammatory markers (Option A). While systemic inflammation can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and increase the risk of stroke, checking for inflammatory markers is not directly relevant to diagnosing TIA or amaurosis fugax. Additionally, while an MRI of the brain (Option C) might provide useful information in some cases of stroke or neurologic symptoms, it is not typically the first step in evaluating a patient with transient vision loss.

An ultrasound of the carotid arteries (Option D) could be considered to evaluate for stenosis or occlusion, but this would likely follow a diagnosis of TIA or amaurosis fugax. A more appropriate initial step would be to assess for systemic inflammation and rule out other potential causes of transient vision loss.

Therefore, checking serum inflammatory markers is the best next step in management, as it can help identify any underlying conditions that may contribute to the patient's symptoms.
