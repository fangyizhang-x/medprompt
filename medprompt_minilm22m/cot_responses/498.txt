(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can deduce that she has stress urinary incontinence (SUI), which is characterized by involuntary urine loss on coughing, sneezing, or physical exertion. The presence of a positive Q-tip test further supports this diagnosis.

Cystometry is a diagnostic tool used to assess the function of the bladder and urethra. In the context of SUI, cystometry can help evaluate the detrusor muscle's ability to contract during filling and emptying phases.

The patient's symptoms suggest that her bladder is underactive or incompetent, leading to involuntary urine loss. The maximal bladder filling phase (C) would likely show increased residual volume due to the incomplete filling of the bladder. However, this does not necessarily mean there are no involuntary detrusor contractions during this phase.

Involuntary detrusor contractions on maximal bladder filling (A) is unlikely because these contractions would be more pronounced and coordinated during the filling phase, which is not observed in SUI.

The presence of painless bulging of the anterior vaginal wall (C) is suggestive of a urethral diverticulum or other urethral pathology. However, this finding does not directly relate to the bladder function assessed by cystometry.

Normal residual volume and no involuntary detrusor contractions on maximal bladder filling (D) would be inconsistent with SUI, as these findings suggest that the patient's bladder is underactive and unable to empty properly.

Therefore, the most likely finding revealed by cystometry in this patient is normal residual volume, indicating that there is some degree of bladder capacity and storage function, but involuntary detrusor contractions are not present during maximal filling.
