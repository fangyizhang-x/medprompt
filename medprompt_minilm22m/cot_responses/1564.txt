## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Chronic lower back pain with morning stiffness and improvement throughout the day**: This pattern is suggestive of an inflammatory condition such as ankylosing spondylitis or reactive arthritis.
2. **Tenderness over the iliac crest bilaterally and limited range of motion of the lumbar spine with forward flexion**: These findings are consistent with spinal inflammation, which can be seen in conditions like ankylosing spondylitis.
3. **Positive HLA-B27 testing**: This is a significant finding as it increases the likelihood of certain inflammatory conditions, including ankylosing spondylitis.
4. **X-ray showing fusion of lumbar vertebrae and sacroiliac joints**: This radiographic finding is highly suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis.

Given these points, the physician's plan to prescribe a new medication that inhibits tuberculosis (TB) reactivation makes sense as a preventive measure against post-primary TB complications in patients with HLA-B27 positive status. The most likely drug for this purpose is **azathioprine**, which is an immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection in organ transplant recipients and to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.

Now, let's consider the options provided:

A. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitors are a class of medications that inhibit DNA synthesis by inhibiting IMPDH, which is necessary for the production of guanine nucleotides. This mechanism is relevant to the treatment of certain cancers and autoimmune diseases but is not directly related to TB reactivation prevention.

B. TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) inhibitors are a class of medications that block the action of TNF-α, which is involved in systemic inflammation. While TNF-α inhibitors are used in treating conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, they are not typically used to prevent TB reactivation.

C. NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) inhibitors are a class of medications that block the action of NF-κB, which is involved in regulating immune responses. While NF-κB inhibitors have anti-inflammatory properties, they are not typically used to prevent TB reactivation.

D. mTOR kinase (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase)
