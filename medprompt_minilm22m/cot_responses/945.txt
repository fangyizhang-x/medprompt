To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of likelihood ratio (LR) and its relationship with the pretest probability.

The likelihood ratio is defined as the ratio of the probability of a positive test result to the probability of a negative test result. In this case, the LR- for Crohn’s disease is 0.04.

We are given that the pretest probability of Crohn’s disease is estimated at 40%. We want to find the chance that the patient has Crohn’s disease if the test result is negative (i.e., the probability of a false positive).

Using the formula for likelihood ratio, we can write:

LR- = P(positive | Crohn's) / P(positive | no Crohn's)

We know that LR- = 0.04 and P(Crohn's) = 0.4 (pretest probability). We need to find P(no Crohn's).

Since the pretest probability is estimated at 40%, we can assume that the probability of a negative test result is also 40% (i.e., P(no Crohn's) = 0.6).

Now, we can plug in the values and solve for P(no Crohn's):

0.04 = 0.4 / 0.6
0.04 × 0.6 = 0.2
P(no Crohn's) = 0.2

To find the probability of a negative test result, we can subtract P(no Crohn's) from 1:

P(negative | no Crohn's) = 1 - P(no Crohn's)
= 1 - 0.2
= 0.8

Now that we have the probability of a false positive (P(negative | no Crohn's)), we can use it to find the probability of a true negative (P(positive | no Crohn's)):

P(positive | no Crohn's) = 1 / P(negative | no Crohn's)
= 1 / 0.8
= 1.25

Finally, we can calculate the probability of a false positive (P(negative | Crohn's)) using the formula:

P(negative | Crohn's) = LR- × P(positive | Crohn's)
= 0.04 × 0.4
= 0.016

Now that we have
