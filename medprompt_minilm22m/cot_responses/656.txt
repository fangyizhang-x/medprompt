## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's analyze the given information:

- The patient has a plasma sodium concentration of 126 mg/dL, which is significantly elevated (hypernatremia).
- She was hospitalized for suicidal ideations and started on a medication for major depressive disorder.
- Her past medical history includes diabetes, for which she is currently taking metformin.
- Blood pressure is around 130/85 mmHg, but this information is not directly relevant to the cell bodies of the cells behaving abnormally in this patient.

The key piece of information here is the serum osmolality of 1085 mOsm/L. Normal serum osmolality ranges from approximately 285-295 mOsm/kg. A serum osmolality of 1085 mOsm/L is significantly higher than normal, indicating that the plasma is hypertonic.

Given this context, we need to consider what could cause a hyperosmotic state in the body. The primary mechanism for producing a hyperosmotic state is through the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, from the posterior pituitary gland into the bloodstream.

The cell bodies responsible for secreting ADH are located in the hypothalamus. Specifically, the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in the hypothalamus contain neurons that produce ADH. When these neurons receive signals to release ADH, it is transported through axons to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored in vesicles called neurosecretory granules.

Therefore, considering the information provided:

- The cell bodies of the cells behaving abnormally are located in the hypothalamus.
- They produce and secrete ADH, leading to a hyperosmotic state in the body.

The other options are incorrect because:
A. Acidophils are not directly related to the regulation of sodium levels or osmolality in this context.
B. Chromophobes are actually a type of melanocyte involved in producing melanin and are not relevant to this scenario.
D. Located in the posterior pituitary gland, but it is the hypothalamus that produces ADH, not the posterior pituitary itself.

Therefore, the answer is C.
