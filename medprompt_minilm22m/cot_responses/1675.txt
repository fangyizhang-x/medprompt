(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, we can deduce that he has significant atherosclerotic disease in his carotid arteries, which is likely causing his shortness of breath, chest pain on exertion, weakness, numbness, or vision disturbances. The presence of systolic bruits over the neck bilaterally further supports this suspicion.

The patient's medical history and physical examination findings are consistent with atherosclerotic disease, particularly in the carotid arteries. His smoking history is also relevant, as it increases his risk for cardiovascular disease.

Fasting serum studies show elevated total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, which are all risk factors for atherosclerosis. The patient's glucose level is within normal limits, but this does not rule out diabetes mellitus, which can be associated with atherosclerotic disease.

Duplex ultrasonography of the carotid arteries confirms the presence of significant stenosis in both carotid arteries, which is consistent with the clinical suspicion of atherosclerotic disease.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform either bilateral carotid endarterectomy (D) or carotid artery stenting (C), as these are both effective treatments for significant carotid stenosis. However, given the patient's age and the presence of significant stenosis in both carotid arteries, bilateral carotid endarterectomy may be more appropriate.

Bilateral carotid endarterectomy is a more invasive procedure that involves removing the diseased portion of both carotid arteries simultaneously. It is generally recommended for patients with significant carotid stenosis who are at high risk for complications or have severe symptoms, such as transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.

Reassurance (B) would not be appropriate given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, which suggest a serious underlying condition. Carotid artery stenting (C) may be considered in patients who are at high risk for complications but do not meet the criteria for bilateral carotid endarterectomy. However, this is not the most appropriate next step in management.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform bilateral carotid endarterectomy to address the significant stenosis in both carotid arteries and alleviate symptoms.
