## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient presents with severe chest pain that began acutely, radiating to the back and shoulders, localized to the center of the chest and retrosternal area. This symptomatology is highly suggestive of an aortic dissection, which is characterized by tearing of the inner layer of the aorta, leading to separation of the layers of the aortic wall.

The patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, as well as his 30-pack-year smoking history, increases his risk for atherosclerotic disease, which is a common cause of aortic dissection. The physical examination findings, including diaphoresis and a grade 2/6 diastolic decrescendo murmur loudest over the left sternal border, are also consistent with an aortic dissection.

The widened mediastinum on chest radiograph is another important finding that supports the diagnosis of an aortic dissection. The electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals non-specific ST segment and T wave changes, which can be seen in various cardiac conditions but are not specific for aortic dissection.

Intravenous morphine and beta-blockers were started to manage the patient's pain and stabilize his cardiovascular system. However, these measures do not address the underlying cause of the chest pain and may even worsen the situation if the dissection is unstable.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and risk factors for aortic dissection, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is A. Aortic dissection.

The other options are less likely:

- B. Pulmonary embolism: While the patient has a history of smoking, which increases his risk for pulmonary embolism, there are no specific findings on the chest radiograph or ECG that would support this diagnosis.
- C. Acute myocardial infarction: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest an acute myocardial infarction.
- D. Aortic regurgitation: While aortic regurgitation can cause chest pain, it is typically associated with a systolic murmur rather than a diastolic decrescendo murmur.

Therefore, the answer is A.
