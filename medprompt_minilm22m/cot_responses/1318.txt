## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Step 1: Analyzing the clinical presentation and history
The patient presents with a swollen face, irritability, red urine (indicative of hematuria), a 'sandpaper' rash, a red tongue with patchy hyperplastic fungiform papillae, proteinuria, elevated antistreptolysin O, and decreased serum C3. These symptoms suggest an autoimmune or inflammatory process.

### Step 2: Identifying the key features of the condition
The presence of a 'sandpaper' rash (which is typically associated with dermatomyositis) and a red tongue with patchy hyperplastic fungiform papillae are particularly suggestive of dermatomyositis, which is often triggered by infections or autoimmune diseases.

### Step 3: Relating the clinical presentation to potential triggers
Given that the patient has had previous episodes of skin rash and oral mucosal changes (which could be indicative of an autoimmune response), we need to consider conditions that are known to trigger such immune-mediated reactions. 

- **Arthus reaction** is a type of local immune complex deposition disease, which can occur after infections or trauma but is not typically associated with the full spectrum of symptoms described.
  
- **Myasthenia gravis** is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease that could potentially cause skin rashes and mucosal changes due to its autoimmune nature. However, it's less commonly associated with the specific constellation of symptoms presented here.

- **Acute rheumatic fever** can be triggered by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections (GABHS), which is consistent with the patient's history of a previous infection (possibly strep throat) and subsequent rash and oral changes. The presence of antistreptolysin O elevation supports this diagnosis.

- **Polyarteritis nodosa** is an autoimmune vasculitis that can cause skin rashes, but it typically presents with more systemic symptoms such as renal failure, fever, and weight loss rather than the specific mucosal changes described here.

- **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)** is a chronic autoimmune disorder primarily affecting joints. While it can have extramusculoskeletal manifestations, the specific combination of skin rash, oral mucosal changes, and elevated antistreptolysin O in this case does not strongly suggest RA as the primary diagnosis.
