## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Sudden leakage of clear fluid from her vagina**: This suggests a possible rupture of membranes (ROM), which can be due to several causes including infection, sexual intercourse during pregnancy, or other factors.

2. **History of chronic hypertension**: While this is relevant for managing blood pressure in the context of pregnancy, it does not directly explain the current symptoms.

3. **Compliance with prenatal care and missed appointments**: This indicates that the patient may have had some issues with follow-up care, but it doesn't directly relate to her current condition.

4. **History of chronic hypertension**: This is a risk factor for preeclampsia, which can cause vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. However, the question does not mention preeclampsia or its complications.

5. **Soft and nontender abdomen on palpation**: This suggests that there may be no significant abdominal pathology at this time.

6. **Speculum examination demonstrates clear fluid in the cervical canal**: This confirms the presence of vaginal bleeding.

7. **Ferning pattern when placed onto a glass slide**: The ferning pattern is indicative of bacterial vaginosis (BV), which is commonly associated with bacterial infections and can cause vaginal discharge, including clear or white discharge.

8. **No contractions on Tocometry**: This suggests that the patient's uterus is not contracting, which could be consistent with a non-reassuring fetal status, such as in cases of preeclampsia or other conditions leading to uteroplacental insufficiency.

Considering these points:

- Option A (Ascending infection) and B (Sexual intercourse during third trimester) are less likely given the absence of fever, abdominal pain, or other signs of infection.
- Option C (Î²-blocker use) is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or history.
- Option D (Alcohol use) could potentially contribute to preeclampsia but does not explain the clear fluid in the cervical canal.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is B. Sexual intercourse during third trimester, as it can lead to bacterial vaginosis and subsequent vaginal bleeding, which matches the clinical presentation described.

The final answer is: $\boxed{B}$
