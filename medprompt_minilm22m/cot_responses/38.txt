## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's understand what we're trying to find out about the properties of this enzyme.

The researcher observes that as the concentration of glucose increases, the rate at which it becomes phosphorylated also increases. This suggests that the enzyme is not saturated with glucose and can continue to add phosphate groups even at high levels of substrate (glucose). This behavior is characteristic of an enzyme that has a high affinity for its substrate.

The researcher then finds that the rate of phosphorylation approaches a maximum speed (Y) as the concentration of glucose increases. This indicates that the enzyme's activity is limited by the availability of its substrate, and increasing the substrate concentration does not significantly increase the rate of reaction.

Now, let's think about what happens when the enzyme is mixed with varying levels of glucose at a saturating concentration of phosphate. The researcher observes that the rate of phosphorylation gets faster as the level of glucose increases. This suggests that the enzyme has a high affinity for its substrate and can continue to add phosphate groups even at higher levels of substrate.

To determine the optimal concentration of glucose (X) needed to make the enzyme function at half the speed Y, we need to think about what happens when the substrate concentration is halved. If the enzyme's activity is limited by the availability of its substrate, then increasing the substrate concentration should increase the rate of reaction. However, if the enzyme has a high affinity for its substrate, then increasing the substrate concentration will not significantly increase the rate of reaction.

Therefore, we can conclude that the optimal concentration of glucose (X) needed to make the enzyme function at half the speed Y is low. This means that X should be less than the maximum substrate concentration (Y).

On the other hand, the rate of phosphorylation approaches a maximum speed as the concentration of glucose increases, which suggests that the enzyme has a high affinity for its substrate and can continue to add phosphate groups even at higher levels of substrate.

Therefore, we can conclude that the kinetic properties of this enzyme are characterized by:

* High X (low optimal substrate concentration)
* Low Y (maximum rate of phosphorylation)

The correct answer is C.
