## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history of peptic ulcer disease and recent upper GI bleeding, it is essential to consider the likelihood of further bleeding in the next few days. Let's analyze each option:

A. Gastric ulcer with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) - AVMs are a known complication of peptic ulcer disease, particularly in patients who have undergone multiple endoscopic treatments for their ulcers. The presence of AVMs increases the risk of bleeding due to the abnormal blood vessels that can rupture and cause bleeding.

B. Visible bleeding vessel - This finding would indicate active bleeding, which is not what we are looking for since the patient has been hemodynamically stable after initial fluid resuscitation.

C. Adherent clot on ulcer - An adherent clot on an ulcer can be a sign of incomplete resection or incomplete healing of the ulcer, but it does not necessarily rule out further bleeding.

D. Clean-based ulcer - A clean-based ulcer is typically a benign finding and does not increase the risk of bleeding.

Considering these factors, the most likely endoscopy finding that indicates this patient will not experience additional GI bleeding in the next few days is an adherent clot on an ulcer (C). This is because an adherent clot can be a sign of incomplete resection or incomplete healing of the ulcer, which increases the risk of further bleeding.

Therefore, the answer is C.
