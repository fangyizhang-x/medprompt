## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, we can deduce that his symptoms are likely related to a fungal infection.

Firstly, the fact that he returned from Puerto Rico 10 days ago and started using a new laundry detergent could suggest an environmental trigger for the rash. However, this is not directly relevant to the underlying mechanism of the condition.

The presence of multiple, nontender, round, hypopigmented macules on the chest and trunk, along with fine scaling when scraped with a spatula, strongly suggests a fungal infection. The fact that these lesions are hypopigmented (lighter than the surrounding skin) and have fine scaling is particularly indicative of a fungal infection.

The most likely underlying mechanism in this case is an increased growth of Malassezia globosa, a type of yeast that is commonly found on the skin and can cause infections when it overgrows. This condition is often associated with excessive sweating, which can lead to a warm, moist environment that fosters the growth of fungi.

The other options are less likely:

A. Autoimmune destruction of melanocytes would more likely result in hyperpigmentation rather than hypopigmentation.

C. Antigen uptake by Langerhans cells is involved in the immune response to fungal infections, but it's not the direct mechanism leading to this patient's symptoms.

D. Infection with Trichophyton rubrum is a common cause of skin infections like ringworm, which can cause lesions on the chest and trunk. However, the presence of fine scaling when scraped suggests that the infection may be more complex than simple ringworm.

Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms is an increased growth of Malassezia globosa, leading to a fungal infection.
