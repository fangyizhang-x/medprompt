Given the patient's symptoms, including localized pain to his wrist, erythema, swelling, and white discharge from the penis with pruritis and pain during urination, we need to consider a differential diagnosis that could explain these symptoms.

The presence of joint pain (knee and elbow) in a sexually active individual raises the possibility of an infectious or inflammatory cause. The patient's history of multiple sexual partners increases his risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

Considering the localized nature of the wrist pain, we should prioritize evaluating the cause of this specific symptom over other potential causes.

Option A, Arthrocentesis, is a diagnostic procedure that involves injecting fluid from the joint to examine its composition. While it can be useful in diagnosing conditions such as septic arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, it's not typically the first step for evaluating localized wrist pain without more specific indications (e.g., joint swelling, redness, warmth).

Option B, Azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin, is a combination antibiotic regimen. Given the patient's symptoms of white discharge from his penis with pruritis and pain during urination, which could indicate a sexually transmitted infection (STI), this option seems more appropriate.

Option C, Methotrexate, is an immunosuppressive medication used in treating autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. While it may be considered for certain cases of joint pain, it's not the first line of treatment for localized wrist pain without more specific indications.

Option D, MRI, can provide detailed images of the joints and soft tissues but is typically reserved for more complex or unclear diagnoses after initial evaluation with other modalities.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms and risk factors, the best next step in management would be to start an antibiotic regimen to address potential STIs.
