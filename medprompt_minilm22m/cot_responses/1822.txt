## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine the current primary location for fetal myelopoiesis, we need to consider the developmental stages and locations of hematopoiesis in the fetus.

At 22 weeks of gestation, the yolk sac is still the primary site of hematopoiesis, which is responsible for the production of red blood cells. However, as the pregnancy progresses, other sites take over different functions.

The liver becomes a major site of hematopoiesis around 20-25 weeks of gestation, and it continues to be so until about 35 weeks. The spleen also starts to play a role in hematopoiesis around this time, but its primary function is the removal of old or damaged red blood cells.

The aorta-gonad-mesonephros region (also known as the gonadal ridge) is not typically associated with hematopoiesis. This region is involved in the development of the reproductive system and is present until about 6-8 weeks of gestation, after which it atrophies and disappears.

Therefore, considering these developmental stages and locations, the current primary location for fetal myelopoiesis at this stage of development would be the liver.

The final answer is: B
