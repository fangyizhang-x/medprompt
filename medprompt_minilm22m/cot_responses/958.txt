## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 4-month-old boy, we can deduce that he has a form of congenital hypoglycemia of the infant type (CHI). This condition is characterized by impaired glucose production in the liver due to an enzymatic defect.

The key features of CHI include:

1. Poor growth and failure to thrive
2. Abnormally enlarged cheeks, also known as macroglossia
3. Elevated blood lactate levels
4. No response to glucagon stimulation test

Elevated blood lactate levels are a hallmark of this condition, indicating that the liver is not producing enough glucose.

The most likely enzymatic defect in CHI is related to the regulation of glucose production in the liver. Let's consider the options:

A. Alpha-1,4-glucosidase: This enzyme is involved in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Deficiency in this enzyme leads to Pompe disease, a type of glycogen storage disorder.

B. Alpha-1,6-glucosidase: This enzyme is also involved in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Deficiency in this enzyme leads to Andersen disease, another type of glycogen storage disorder.

C. Glucose-6-phosphatase: This enzyme is crucial for the final step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, converting glucose-6-phosphate into glucose. Deficiency in this enzyme leads to von Gierke's disease, a form of glycogen storage disorder.

D. Glycogen synthase: This enzyme is involved in glycogen synthesis. While its deficiency can lead to glycogen storage diseases, it is less commonly associated with the clinical presentation described.

Given the elevated blood lactate levels and the absence of response to glucagon stimulation test, which are characteristic features of CHI, we can conclude that the most likely enzymatic defect present is related to glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency. This enzyme plays a critical role in the final step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, making it essential for glucose production in the liver.

Therefore, the answer is C. Glucose-6-phosphatase.
