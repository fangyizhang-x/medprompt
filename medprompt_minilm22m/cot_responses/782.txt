## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Initially, the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of acute angioedema (swollen lips, tongue, and face), which is a known side effect of ACE inhibitors like captopril. This condition requires immediate attention to prevent further complications.

Given that captopril was initiated, we need to consider alternative treatments for high blood pressure while managing the acute angioedema.

A) Reinitiating captopril would not be appropriate as it could potentially worsen the angioedema and is no longer indicated due to its side effect profile.

B) Initiating an ARB (Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker) is a suitable alternative for managing high blood pressure in this scenario. ARBs are effective in lowering blood pressure without causing significant angioedema, making them a good choice for patients with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema.

C) Initiating a beta-blocker would not be appropriate as it could potentially worsen the angioedema by further reducing blood pressure and increasing the risk of hypotension.

D) Initiating a thiazide diuretic might actually increase blood pressure, which is undesirable in this scenario where the patient already has high blood pressure. Additionally, thiazides can cause electrolyte imbalances that could exacerbate angioedema.

Therefore, the most appropriate step for managing his high blood pressure after initiating captopril and experiencing acute angioedema would be to initiate an ARB.
