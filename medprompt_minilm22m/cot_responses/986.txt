## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of primary aldosteronism (PA), characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia, along with an elevated plasma renin activity level. The failure to respond to a sodium loading test further supports the diagnosis of PA.

Given the presence of a 3-cm, homogenous, right-sided adrenal mass on CT scan, which is likely an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), the most appropriate next step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis and assess for potential bilateral adrenal involvement. This can be done through adrenal vein sampling (AVS).

AVS involves the selective sampling of blood from the left and right adrenal veins to measure aldosterone production. If AVS is negative, it suggests that the APA is unilateral, which may not require surgical intervention.

In contrast, bilateral adrenalectomy would be considered if:

- The patient has a large mass (>5 cm) or multiple masses.
- There are signs of bilateral adrenal failure (e.g., hypotension, hyperkalemia).
- The patient's symptoms are severe and unresponsive to medical management.

Spironolactone therapy is not typically used as a first-line treatment for PA due to its potential side effects. Right adrenalectomy may be considered in certain cases but is generally reserved for patients with bilateral adrenal disease or those who do not respond to medical management.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is adrenal vein sampling (C).
