## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the information provided, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Age and Presentation**: The patient is a 14-year-old boy presenting to your practice. This age group can be relevant for certain conditions that are more common in adolescents.

2. **Observations from Figures A and B**: Although we don't have direct access to Figures A and B, the description of them suggests some sort of skin or eye condition. The presence of ash-leaf spots (A) is a key finding often associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which can also present in children.

3. **Considering NF1**: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is characterized by multiple cafe-au-lait macules, freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions, and various other features such as iris hamartomas, neurofibromas, and Lisch nodules. The presence of ash-leaf spots (A) strongly suggests NF1.

4. **Eliminating Other Options**:
   - B. A family history of seizures and mental retardation is not directly supported by the information provided.
   - C. Iris hamartomas are a common feature in neurofibromatosis type 1, but they can also be found in other conditions like von Hippel-Lindau disease or as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes.
   - D. A white tuft of scalp hair since birth is more characteristic of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which typically presents with a different set of features, including ash-leaf spots.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the presence of ash-leaf spots and considering the age of the patient, the most likely additional finding in this case would be iris hamartomas, as they are strongly associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.

Therefore, the answer is C.
