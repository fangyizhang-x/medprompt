## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of rapid memory loss, personality changes, sudden jerking movements (indicative of parkinsonism), gait disturbances, and coma leading to death, this patient likely suffered from a neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia.

The presence of parkinsonian symptoms (such as tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia) is particularly suggestive of Parkinson's disease. However, the rapid progression of symptoms and the specific combination of cognitive decline, personality changes, and autonomic dysfunction are more characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

In Alzheimer's disease, the brain undergoes significant atrophy, particularly in areas responsible for memory and cognition, such as the hippocampus and temporal lobe. The disease also often presents with amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which can be seen on autopsy.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms and the likely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, the most likely finding on autopsy would be:
