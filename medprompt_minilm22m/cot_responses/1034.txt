## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, including worsening tics and difficulty walking over a 3-year period, along with prominent atrophy of the caudate nucleus on MRI, we can deduce that his condition is likely related to a neurodegenerative disorder. The fact that he has been taking anti-anxiety medications without a prescription for years suggests that he may be suffering from a condition that requires long-term management.

The patient's history of foster care and lack of a family medical history also raises the possibility of an inherited or genetic condition. The presence of prominent atrophy of the caudate nucleus on MRI is particularly suggestive of Huntington's disease (HD), which is characterized by progressive damage to the basal ganglia, including the caudate nucleus.

The trinucleotide repeats associated with HD are CAG. This repeat expansion leads to an increase in the length of the CAG sequence, which can cause neuronal degeneration and lead to the symptoms observed in patients with HD.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, MRI findings, and family history, the most likely diagnosis is Huntington's disease, which is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion of 3-36 repeats in the HTT gene.
