## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's sudden loss of vision in one eye without pain, this suggests an acute event rather than a chronic condition like multiple sclerosis or diabetes mellitus. The presence of a white ring around the circumference of the cornea (choroidal detachment) and soft exudates in the superior and nasal retinal quadrants in both eyes also points towards a vitreous hemorrhage as a likely diagnosis.

The patient's history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and multiple sclerosis is relevant but does not directly explain the acute onset of vision loss. The recent myocardial infarction could be related to her cardiovascular condition, but there are no specific symptoms or signs that would suggest it as a cause for her current visual disturbance.

The direct pupillary reflex being brisk in the left eye and absent in the right eye is indicative of an optic nerve issue, which could be due to various causes including vitreous hemorrhage. The absence of perception of light in the right eye further supports this diagnosis.

Intraocular pressure (IOP) is elevated in both eyes, with a higher value in the left eye, but this finding alone does not explain the acute visual loss. The presence of a white ring around the cornea and soft exudates in the retina could be indicative of retinal detachment or another vitreoretinal issue.

The fundoscopic examination findings are consistent with a vitreous hemorrhage, which is characterized by bleeding into the vitreous gel that can cause sudden vision loss. The optic disc appears normal, which makes acute angle-closure glaucoma less likely as it typically presents with increased intraocular pressure and signs of optic nerve damage.

Therefore, considering all the findings, the most likely diagnosis is a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), which is an ischemic event that can cause sudden vision loss due to the blockage of blood flow to the retina. This condition often occurs in older adults with risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus.

The answer choices:
A. Central serous retinopathy - unlikely given the acute onset, vitreous hemorrhage signs, and lack of mention of serous detachment.
B. Acute angle-closure glaucoma - less likely due to normal optic disc appearance and absence of increased intraocular pressure.
C. Vitreous hemorrhage - most likely diagnosis based on sudden vision loss, vitreous ring
