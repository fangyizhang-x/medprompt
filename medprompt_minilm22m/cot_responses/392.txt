## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, we can analyze her condition step by step:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with swelling of her legs and face, which worsens in the morning and improves during the day. This is suggestive of edema, particularly around the face and lower limbs.

2. **Diagnosis**: She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus a year ago and has been non-compliant with metformin. The presence of edema, especially in the context of uncontrolled diabetes, raises suspicion for diabetic nephropathy or other complications associated with diabetes.

3. **Laboratory Results**:
   - Elevated fasting plasma glucose (164 mg/dL) confirms hyperglycemia.
   - High HbA1c (10.4%) indicates poor glycemic control over the past year.
   - Hypertriglyceridemia (194.7 mg/dL) is a common finding in diabetes due to insulin resistance and increased lipolysis.
   - Elevated creatinine (1.8 mg/dL) suggests impaired renal function, which can be seen in diabetic nephropathy or other kidney diseases.
   - Normal urea nitrogen and calcium levels do not directly point towards any specific cause of her laboratory results.

4. **Analysis**:
   - The patient's edema is most likely due to fluid retention, which could be exacerbated by the uncontrolled diabetes.
   - The elevated creatinine level suggests impaired kidney function, consistent with diabetic nephropathy or another renal issue.
   - The hyperglycemia and high HbA1c levels are indicative of poor glycemic control.

5. **PTH Level**: Elevated PTH (parathyroid hormone) is typically associated with conditions that lead to increased calcium levels in the blood, such as hypercalcemia. However, in this context, the patient's serum calcium level is actually decreased (9.6 mg/dL), which would more likely be indicative of hypoparathyroidism.

6. **1α, 25(OH)2D3 Production**: The increase in 1α, 25(OH)2D3 production can contribute to the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism, a condition that occurs when there is an imbalance between calcium and phosphate levels in the blood due to chronic kidney disease or other conditions. This could be a contributing factor to her laboratory results.
