Firstly, it's essential to understand the context of the case: a 23-year-old woman with gonorrhea has been treated appropriately with ceftriaxone and doxycycline. The next step is to consider the potential co-infections that may be present.

Gonorrhea can cause several complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. However, PID is typically diagnosed through imaging studies such as ultrasound or CT scans, not ultrasonography.

Regarding the treatment of potential co-infections with syphilis, it's crucial to note that gonorrhea and syphilis are two distinct bacterial infections caused by different pathogens (Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Treponema pallidum, respectively). While both can cause sexually transmitted infections, they have different treatment regimens.

Penicillin G is not the recommended treatment for syphilis. In fact, penicillin G is contraindicated in patients with penicillin allergies or those who are allergic to penicillin.

Treating her partner for gonorrhea and chlamydia is essential but does not address the potential co-infection of syphilis. Chlamydia can be treated with azithromycin, doxycycline, or erythromycin, depending on the patient's symptoms and risk factors.

Performing an abdominal ultrasonography to rule out PID is not recommended as a routine step in the treatment of gonorrhea. While imaging studies may be necessary to diagnose PID, they are typically performed after the initiation of antibiotic therapy to confirm the diagnosis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to inform her that her partner is likely cheating on her, which can help address potential social and emotional concerns related to the infection. This approach also acknowledges the importance of addressing the co-infection with syphilis while ensuring that the patient receives proper treatment for gonorrhea.

The final answer is: C
