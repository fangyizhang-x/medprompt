Firstly, let's consider the context provided by the obstetrician - antenatal and peripartum antiretroviral therapy to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

The question then shifts focus to the potential risks associated with certain antiretroviral drugs taken during pregnancy. The key here is understanding which antiretroviral drugs are known to increase the risk of birth defects in the fetus if taken during pregnancy.

- **Abacavir and Didanosine (A)**: Both of these drugs are part of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) class, which has been associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations when used during pregnancy. However, they are not typically highlighted as a high-risk category for birth defects in the same way that some other NRTIs might be.
  
- **Efavirenz and Delavirdine (B)**: Efavirenz is classified as a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), which has been linked to an increased risk of congenital malformations. However, delavirdine is actually known for having a lower risk compared to efavirenz in this context.

- **Lopinavir and Ritonavir (C)**: This combination is part of the protease inhibitor (PI) class, which has been associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations. However, it's worth noting that the risk is generally considered lower compared to some other antiretroviral drugs.

- **Nelfinavir and Saquinavir (D)**: Both of these are also part of the protease inhibitor class, which has been linked to an increased risk of congenital malformations. However, they are often included in the same category as Lopinavir/Ritonavir due to their similar risks.

Given this information, the most likely drugs to be present on a list emphasizing the need for caution during pregnancy would include those that have been associated with an increased risk of birth defects. Considering the options provided and focusing on the context of antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy:

- **Efavirenz (B)** is highlighted as a drug that increases the risk of congenital malformations, making it a strong candidate for being included on such a list.
  
- **Nelfinavir and Saquinavir (D
