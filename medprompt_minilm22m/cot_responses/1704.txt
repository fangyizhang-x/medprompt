## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To calculate the relative risk (RR) of death from a cardiac cause, we need to compare the incidence rates of death from cardiac causes between the two groups.

First, let's calculate the incidence rate of death from cardiac causes in each group:

Medication 1: 134 deaths / 1500 patients = 0.089 deaths per 1000 patients
Medication 2: 210 deaths / 1500 patients = 0.14 deaths per 1000 patients

Next, we can calculate the relative risk (RR) using the formula:

RR = Incidence rate of Medication 1 / Incidence rate of Medication 2
= 0.089 / 0.14
= 0.639

To convert this to a percentage, we can multiply by 100:

RR â‰ˆ 63.9%

However, since the question asks for the relative risk rounded to the nearest whole number, we round it to 64%.

Therefore, the answer is C.
