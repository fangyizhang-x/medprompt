## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's assess the situation and prioritize the patient's safety:

1. The patient has a lacerated face and is bleeding from his mouth.
2. One of his teeth is found on the sidewalk, which suggests that there may be significant blood loss.

Given these factors, we need to choose the best method for transporting the tooth to minimize further damage or complications.

A. Submerged in milk - Milk is not a suitable option because it can cause the tooth to become dislodged due to its high pH level and lack of oxygen, leading to pulp necrosis (tooth death).

B. Submerged in normal saline - Normal saline is isotonic and does not contain any substances that could cause further damage or complications. It also helps to keep the tooth moist, which can aid in healing.

C. Submerged in water - Water may not be sufficient to keep the tooth moist and could potentially cause it to become dislodged due to its high surface tension.

D. Wrapped in gauze soaked in normal saline - While this option provides some protection for the tooth, it is still not as effective as submerging the tooth in a more oxygen-rich solution like normal saline.

Therefore, the best method to transport this patient's tooth is to submerge it in normal saline.

The final answer is: B
