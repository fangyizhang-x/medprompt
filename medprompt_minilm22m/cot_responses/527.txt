## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To solve this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the context**: The patient is taking insulin for diabetes mellitus type 1, which requires regular administration to maintain blood glucose levels within a narrow range.

2. **Identifying key concepts**: Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells. It does this by signaling changes in the cell membrane that allow glucose to enter the cell.

3. **Analyzing the options**:
   - A. Increased permeability of the cell membrane to positively charged molecules: This option describes the mechanism of action for insulin, which is to increase the permeability of the cell membrane to glucose (a negatively charged molecule) allowing it to enter the cell.
   - B. Activation of tyrosine kinase: While tyrosine kinases are involved in signaling pathways that can lead to various cellular responses, they are not directly associated with the primary mechanism of insulin action.
   - C. Increased concentration intracellular cAMP: This option describes a different signaling pathway involving cyclic AMP (cAMP), which is involved in various cellular processes but is not the primary mechanism by which insulin acts.
   - D. Rapid and direct upregulation of enzyme transcription: This option refers to changes in gene expression, which can occur as part of an immune response or other cellular reactions but is not directly related to the action of insulin.

4. **Selecting the correct answer**: Based on the understanding that insulin works by increasing the permeability of cells to glucose (a negatively charged molecule), the correct answer is A. Increased permeability of the cell membrane to positively charged molecules.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$
