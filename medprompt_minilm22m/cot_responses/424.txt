## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, including worsening asthma symptoms, increased smoking, and laboratory results showing proteinuria and microscopic hematuria, we can deduce that the patient likely has a condition known as small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with pulmonary metastasis.

The presence of wheezes bilaterally on physical examination is consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is often associated with smoking. The patient's history of increased smoking from 17 years old to 1 pack per day during the past month, combined with his worsening asthma symptoms and COPD-like findings, supports this diagnosis.

The elevated leukocyte count with a predominance of segmented neutrophils suggests an acute inflammatory response, which is consistent with infection or inflammation. However, given the patient's history of smoking and worsening respiratory symptoms, it is more likely that he has an underlying chronic condition such as SCLC.

The presence of proteinuria and microscopic hematuria on urinalysis further supports the diagnosis of a renal condition associated with SCLC. The elevated creatinine level also indicates impaired kidney function.

The patient's IgA deposits are typically seen in conditions like IgA nephropathy, which is not supported by the provided laboratory results.

c-ANCA levels and p-ANCA levels are markers for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), a different condition that can cause respiratory symptoms but does not fit this patient's presentation.

Therefore, considering the patient's smoking history, worsening asthma symptoms, COPD-like findings, proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and elevated creatinine level, the most likely diagnosis is small cell lung cancer with pulmonary metastasis.
