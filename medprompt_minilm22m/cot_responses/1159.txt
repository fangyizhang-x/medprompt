## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

## Step 1: Identify the initial action taken by the infectious disease chairperson.
The chairperson proposes an initiative to restrict the usage of clindamycin in the hospital.

## Step 2: Determine the outcome of this initial action.
After 2 months, she reviews the hospital infection data and determines that the incidence of C. difficile infections has decreased.

## Step 3: Analyze the next step taken by the chairperson based on the outcome.
However, the decrease in incidence is not to the extent that she had hoped.

## Step 4: Identify the action taken after the initial review.
Consequently, she decides to include fluoroquinolone antibiotics in the antibiotic restriction and examine the data again in another 2 months.

## Step 5: Determine why this additional step was taken.
This is likely because the chairperson wants to further investigate if including fluoroquinolone antibiotics has a significant impact on reducing C. difficile infections, given that the decrease achieved with clindamycin alone was not sufficient.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
