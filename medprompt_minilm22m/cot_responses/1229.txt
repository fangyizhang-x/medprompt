## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including decreased lateral eye movement and elevated opening pressure in the lumbar puncture, we can deduce that she likely has pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension), a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without an obvious cause.

Pseudotumor cerebri is often treated with corticosteroids, which are known to have various side effects. The most relevant side effect of corticosteroids among the options provided is:

B. Rhabdomyolysis

Rhabdomyolysis is a serious condition that occurs when muscle tissue breaks down and releases myoglobin into the bloodstream. Corticosteroids can cause rhabdomyolysis as a side effect, particularly at high doses or in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.

The other options are less likely to be associated with corticosteroid treatment:

A. Kidney stones: While corticosteroids can increase the risk of kidney stone formation due to their effects on calcium and phosphate metabolism, this is not a common side effect.

C. Decreased white blood cell count: Corticosteroids typically increase white blood cell counts as part of their immunosuppressive effects.

D. Pancreatitis: While corticosteroids can cause pancreatitis in rare cases, it is not a commonly reported side effect and is more likely to occur with high doses or in patients with pre-existing pancreatic disease.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B. Rhabdomyolysis, which is a known side effect of corticosteroid treatment.
