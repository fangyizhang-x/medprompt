## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's symptoms and history suggest that she has cholelithiasis, or gallstones. The presence of multiple stones in the gallbladder as confirmed by ultrasonography is a strong indicator of this condition.

To approach this question, let's consider each option:

A. Elevated uric acid levels can cause gout, which presents with acute onset joint pain and swelling, typically affecting the big toe. This does not match the patient's symptoms of right upper quadrant abdominal pain and nausea.

B. Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme that breaks down certain substances in the body, but it is not directly related to gallstone formation. While some bacteria can produce beta-glucuronidase as a byproduct of their metabolism, this is not a primary mechanism for gallstone formation.

C. Gallstones are typically radiolucent on X-ray imaging, meaning they do not show up on plain films. This option contradicts the patient's ultrasonography findings, which showed multiple stones in the gallbladder that appeared as radiopaque (visible) structures on the ultrasound image.

D. Bile supersaturated with cholesterol is a well-known mechanism for the formation of cholesterol gallstones. These stones are more likely to form when bile contains high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, often due to conditions such as primary biliary cholangitis or chronic pancreatitis. Given the patient's history of fatty food precipitating similar episodes, this option is highly plausible.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and laboratory findings, the most likely explanation for her gallstones is that they are formed due to bile supersaturated with cholesterol.
