(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient presents with severe, sudden-onset upper abdominal pain, fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, which are indicative of a life-threatening condition such as perforated ulcer. The fact that the patient had been complaining of abdominal pain and diarrhea for several months but only recently started taking ibuprofen suggests that there may be an underlying cause.

The presence of multiple ulcers in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum on autopsy is highly suggestive of a chronic condition rather than an acute event. The fact that the patient had been taking ibuprofen for lower back pain for only 3 weeks also raises suspicion for NSAID-induced gastritis or peptic ulcer disease.

The most likely cause of this patient's presentation is Chronic NSAID use (D). This is supported by several pieces of evidence:

1. The patient's symptoms began after he started taking ibuprofen, which is a common NSAID.
2. The patient had been complaining of abdominal pain and diarrhea for several months before the onset of his current symptoms, suggesting that there may be an underlying chronic condition.
3. The presence of multiple ulcers in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum on autopsy supports the diagnosis of chronic gastritis or peptic ulcer disease.

The other options are less likely:

A. A gastrin-secreting tumor of the pancreas (C) is a rare cause of peptic ulcer disease, but it would not explain the patient's symptoms or the presence of multiple ulcers in different parts of the stomach and duodenum.

B. Cytomegalovirus infection (B) can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain and diarrhea, but it would not explain the presence of multiple ulcers in different parts of the stomach and duodenum.

C. H. pylori infection (A) is a common cause of peptic ulcer disease, but it would not explain the patient's symptoms or the presence of multiple ulcers in different parts of the stomach and duodenum.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's presentation is Chronic NSAID use (D).
