## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, let's break down the key points:

1. **Fever, chills, nausea, and urinary urgency and frequency**: These symptoms are non-specific but can be associated with various urinary tract infections (UTIs), pyelonephritis, or other conditions.

2. **Progressive worsening of symptoms over 4 days**: This suggests a more severe infection or an underlying condition that is not responding to treatment.

3. **Past medical history of recurrent UTIs**: While this information is relevant, it does not directly impact the current diagnosis but may be considered in the differential diagnosis.

4. **Physical examination findings**: Moderate left costovertebral angle tenderness is a significant finding that suggests pyelonephritis or an obstructing renal stone.

5. **Laboratory findings**:
   - Elevated WBC count (8,500/mm^3) indicates an inflammatory response.
   - RBCs and hemoglobin are elevated, suggesting hematuria (blood in the urine).
   - Urinalysis shows dark yellow color, turbid clarity, pH 6.5, specific gravity 1.026, glucose, ketones, nitrites, leukocyte esterase, and bacteria. The presence of many bacteria and positive nitrites is highly suggestive of a bacterial infection.
   - Proteinuria (trace) could be present but is not mentioned in the urinalysis.

Considering these points:

- **Pyelonephritis (A)**: This condition typically presents with more severe symptoms such as flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. While the patient has left-sided costovertebral angle tenderness, pyelonephritis usually involves more significant renal inflammation and is less likely given the lack of other systemic symptoms.

- **Uncomplicated cystitis (B)**: This condition typically presents with dysuria (painful urination), frequency, urgency, and sometimes a burning sensation during urination. The patient's symptoms do not match this diagnosis well.

- **UTI (C)**: Given the presence of bacteria in the urine, positive nitrites, leukocyte esterase, and WBCs, UTI is the most likely diagnosis. However, the patient's fever and left-sided costovertebral angle tenderness are more suggestive of pyelonephritis.

- **Acute obstructing nephrolithiasis (D)**: This condition
