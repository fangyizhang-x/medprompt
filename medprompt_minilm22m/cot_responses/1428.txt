## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's initial blood pressure reading of 150/90 mm Hg and subsequent readings of 140/90 mm Hg, along with his normal physical examination and electrocardiogram (ECG), it appears that the patient has been successfully managing his hypertension through lifestyle modifications and medication. However, the patient's serum glucose level is elevated at 88 mg/dL.

The American Heart Association recommends that individuals with hypertension who are also diabetic or prediabetic should be treated to improve glycemic control. The patient's elevated fasting glucose level suggests that he may benefit from additional treatment beyond just lifestyle modifications and medication.

Considering the patient's current medications, lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) is likely being used to treat his hypertension. However, given the patient's elevated serum glucose level, it is reasonable to consider adding a medication that can help improve glycemic control while also addressing his hypertension.

Among the options provided:

A. Atorvastatin is a statin, which is primarily used to lower cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular disease. While it may have some benefits in terms of reducing inflammation and improving lipid profiles, it does not directly address the patient's elevated serum glucose level.

B. Niacin (nicotinic acid) is a medication that can help improve glycemic control by increasing insulin sensitivity and decreasing glucose production in the liver. It is often used in combination with other medications to treat type 2 diabetes.

C. Gemfibrozil is a fibrate, which is primarily used to lower cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular disease. While it may have some benefits in terms of improving lipid profiles, it does not directly address the patient's elevated serum glucose level.

D. Orlistat is a weight loss medication that works by inhibiting pancreatic lipase, an enzyme that breaks down fats in the intestine. It can also help improve glycemic control by reducing postprandial glucose levels. However, its primary indication is for weight management, and it may not be the best choice for this patient.

Given the patient's elevated serum glucose level and the need to address both his hypertension and diabetes, adding a medication that can help improve glycemic control would be an appropriate next step. Niacin (B) appears to be the most suitable option among those provided.

The final answer is: B
