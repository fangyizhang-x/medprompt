## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's analyze the symptoms and examination findings:

1. Painless swelling in the right cheek when playing the tuba suggests a possible issue with the parotid gland.
2. Slight facial asymmetry due to minor swelling on the right side of the face indicates that there might be an imbalance or dysfunction in the parotid gland, which could be related to its function.
3. The smooth skin over the swelling without any secondary changes suggests that it's not a result of infection or inflammation.
4. Palpation reveals a soft and non-tender swelling, which is consistent with a benign condition like a parotid cyst or an abscess.
5. Normal oral opening without trismus (difficulty opening the mouth) indicates that there are no significant issues with the muscles involved in mastication.
6. Further examination reveals swelling of the left buccal mucosa extending from the first to the third molar, which is consistent with a parotid gland issue on the opposite side.

Given these findings, we need to identify the nerve responsible for motor function related to preventing air from entering the affected duct (parotid gland).

The correct answer can be deduced by considering the anatomy of the facial nerve (CN VII) and its branches:

- The buccal branch of CN VII is a branch that supplies the muscles of facial expression, including those involved in mastication.
- The marginal mandibular branch of CN VII also supplies the muscles of mastication.

However, the question specifically asks about preventing air from entering the affected duct. This function is primarily related to the buccinator muscle, which is innervated by the buccal branch of CN VII.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. CN VII – Buccal branch.

The other options are incorrect because:

- A. V2 (Maxillary nerve) is responsible for sensory functions in the face and does not have a motor function related to preventing air from entering the parotid gland.
- B. V3 (Mandibular nerve) is also involved with facial sensation but has no motor function related to this specific issue.
- D. CN VII – Marginal mandibular branch supplies muscles of mastication, not preventing air from entering the affected duct.
