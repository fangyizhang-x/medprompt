Given the clinical presentation of this 8-week pregnant woman, the most critical step is to determine if she has been exposed to rubella (German measles). The presence of a fine pink and itchy rash that started on her face and spread to her neck, along with lymphadenopathy in the posterior auricular nodes, strongly suggests a diagnosis of rubella.

The fact that she has had many sick contacts while working in the hospital increases the risk of exposure. Rubella is highly contagious during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, and even mild cases can lead to congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) if the fetus is infected.

Option A, administering anti-rubella antibodies, is not appropriate as it would delay diagnosis and treatment of a potentially serious infection.

Option B, admitting the patient and placing her in isolation, may be necessary to prevent further transmission to others, but it does not address the underlying issue of potential congenital rubella syndrome if she becomes pregnant.

Option C, testing for rubella antibodies in her blood, is not the most appropriate next step. While this could provide information about past exposure, it would not rule out a current infection or confirm that she has been exposed to rubella.

Option D, termination of pregnancy, may be considered in certain circumstances, such as if the patient has severe congenital rubella syndrome or if there are other indications for abortion. However, this decision should be made after careful consideration of the risks and benefits, as well as consultation with a multidisciplinary team including obstetricians, neonatologists, and geneticists.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or confirmatory rubella virus isolation to determine if the patient has been exposed to rubella. This will guide further management, which may include antiviral therapy for any current infection, close monitoring of her pregnancy, and consideration of termination of pregnancy if necessary.

The final answer is: C
