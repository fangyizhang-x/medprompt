Given the patient's presentation, we should consider his risk factors for prostate cancer and the current guidelines for screening.

Firstly, the patient has a significant family history of prostate cancer, which increases his risk. However, this is not sufficient on its own to recommend immediate screening without considering other factors.

The patient's past medical history includes hypertension, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and potentially prostate cancer. However, there is no indication that he currently has symptoms or signs suggestive of prostate cancer.

The patient's current medication, hydrochlorothiazide, may have some effects on the prostate, but this would not be sufficient to warrant screening at this time.

Regarding alcohol consumption, moderate drinking (1-2 drinks per day) is generally considered safe for most adults. However, in the context of prostate cancer screening, it's essential to consider that even light exposure to UV radiation from sunlight can increase PSA levels and potentially lead to false positives.

Considering these factors, the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend against routine screening for prostate cancer in asymptomatic men with a family history of the disease. Instead, they suggest that men with a strong family history or other high-risk factors should discuss their individual risk assessment with their doctor and consider alternative screening options.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate recommendation would be to advise the patient not to undergo routine screening at this time (A). This is because his current risk factors do not warrant immediate screening, and there are no indications that he currently has symptoms or signs suggestive of prostate cancer. Additionally, considering his family history, it's essential to discuss alternative options with him.

The serum PSA level (B) would be a useful test for detecting prostate cancer, but it is not the most appropriate initial recommendation in this case. The patient's current medication does not increase his risk of prostate cancer, and there are no indications that he currently has symptoms or signs suggestive of the disease.

Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) (C) may be considered as part of a comprehensive evaluation for prostate cancer, but it is typically reserved for men with high-risk factors or those who have had negative screening results. In this case, given his family history and current risk factors, TRUS would not be the most appropriate initial recommendation.

Contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis (D) may be considered as part of a comprehensive evaluation for prostate cancer, but it is typically reserved for men with high-risk
