Given the patient's symptoms, including recurrent menstrual pain that is more severe than typical cramps during her periods, pain during intercourse, and a tender right adnexal mass on exam, we need to consider conditions that could cause these symptoms in a postmenopausal woman.

Firstly, the presence of a tender right adnexal mass suggests an abnormality within the reproductive system. The fact that it is located near the uterus and causes pain during intercourse further supports this suspicion.

The patient's history of kyphoscoliosis requiring spinal fusion and severe acne rosacea may be relevant in considering conditions that affect multiple systems, but they do not directly explain the adnexal mass or menstrual symptoms.

The family history of ovarian cancer in her mother and endometrial cancer in her paternal grandmother is a significant risk factor for endometrial cancer. Given this history, we should consider an underlying condition that increases the risk of endometrial cancer, such as atypical hyperplasia or endometrial polyps.

Option A, benign proliferation of uterine myometrium, does not explain the adnexal mass or menstrual symptoms. Option B, chronic inflammation of the uterine endometrium, could be a cause of menstrual pain but would not typically present with an adnexal mass. Option C, endometrial glands and stroma within the peritoneal cavity, is more consistent with atypical hyperplasia or endometrial polyps.

Given these considerations, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is option D, endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine myometrium. This would explain both the adnexal mass and the menstrual symptoms, as well as the increased risk of endometrial cancer based on her family history.

Therefore, the answer is D.
