## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's recent diagnosis of hypertension, history of smoking, and bilateral narrowing of renal arteries as shown by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), we need to consider medications that could cause acute renal failure in this context.

Firstly, let's evaluate each medication option:

A. Verapamil - This is a calcium channel blocker used primarily for hypertension and angina. While it can cause hypotension, which might lead to decreased blood flow to the kidneys, it is not typically associated with acute renal failure.

B. Hydralazine - This is a vasodilator commonly used in the treatment of hypertension. It can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure, leading to decreased perfusion of organs, including the kidneys. However, its association with acute renal failure is more commonly seen with long-term use rather than as a side effect of starting therapy.

C. Captopril - This is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which is known to cause nephrotoxicity and acute renal failure, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or those who are sensitive to its effects. The bilateral narrowing of the renal arteries as seen on MRA could be a contributing factor to this patient's condition.

D. Hydrochlorothiazide - This is a diuretic used primarily for hypertension. While it can cause hypokalemia and electrolyte imbalances, which might lead to acute kidney injury, its direct association with bilateral renal artery narrowing leading to acute renal failure is less clear compared to ACE inhibitors.

Considering the patient's recent diagnosis of hypertension, history of smoking, and the presence of bilateral renal artery narrowing on MRA, the most likely cause of his acute renal failure is an adverse effect of one of these medications. Among the options provided, Captopril stands out as the medication that could plausibly lead to this condition due to its known nephrotoxic effects.

The final answer is: C
