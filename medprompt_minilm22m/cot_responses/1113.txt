The clinical presentation of a painless swelling of the testes with an intra-testicular solid mass is highly suggestive of testicular cancer, specifically seminoma in this case.

Firstly, let's consider the location and nature of the tumor. Testicular seminomas are known to be highly vascular, which means they have a rich blood supply. This characteristic can lead to the formation of lymphatic vessels within the tumor itself, making it more likely for these vessels to drain into nearby lymph nodes.

The superficial inguinal lymph nodes (B) are located in the groin area and are primarily involved with draining lymph from the lower limb, perineum, and scrotum. While they can be involved in testicular cancer, especially in cases of metastasis or advanced disease, they are not the most likely initial site for lymph node involvement.

The superficial inguinal lymph nodes (D) are also less likely to be involved initially because of their location and the fact that seminomas tend to drain into deeper lymph nodes first.

The deep inguinal lymph nodes (C), on the other hand, are located along the spermatic cord and are more proximal to the testes. They play a crucial role in draining lymph from the scrotum, testicles, and surrounding tissues. Given that seminomas tend to drain into these lymph nodes first due to their proximity and vascular nature, it is highly likely that the deep inguinal lymph nodes would be involved.

Therefore, considering the clinical presentation and the characteristics of testicular seminoma, the most likely group of lymph nodes involved are the deep inguinal lymph nodes (C).

The para-aortic lymph nodes (A) can also be involved in testicular cancer, but they are less commonly the initial site for lymph node involvement compared to the deep inguinal lymph nodes.

The superficial inguinal lymph nodes (B) are not typically involved as an initial site of lymph node metastasis from a testicular seminoma.
