(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's consider the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and its potential effects on the body.

1. **Vitamin D's role**: Vitamin D is crucial for maintaining bone health by regulating calcium levels in the blood. It also plays a role in immune function and may have implications for cardiovascular health.
   
2. **Effect of vitamin D deficiency**: A moderate deficiency can lead to decreased absorption of calcium from food, which might result in lower serum calcium levels.

3. **Electrolyte balance**: The relationship between electrolytes like calcium and phosphate is complex but generally involves the kidneys regulating their balance. Vitamin D deficiency could potentially affect this by altering renal function or affecting the expression of genes involved in mineral metabolism.

4. **Considering the options**:
   - A: Increased calcium and decreased phosphate. This option does not align with a vitamin D deficiency, as increased phosphate would typically be associated with conditions like hyperparathyroidism.
   - B: Decreased calcium and increased phosphate. While this could occur due to various reasons, it is less directly related to the typical effects of vitamin D deficiency on mineral balance compared to option C.
   - C: Decreased calcium and decreased phosphate. This option aligns with a potential consequence of vitamin D deficiency, as both calcium and phosphate levels can be affected by the body's need for more calcium due to low vitamin D levels.
   - D: Normal calcium and decreased phosphate. While this might seem plausible, it does not accurately reflect the typical effects of vitamin D deficiency on mineral balance.

Given these considerations, the most likely consequence of a moderate vitamin D deficiency in this patient would be a decrease in serum calcium levels (due to impaired absorption) alongside an increase in phosphate levels (as the body attempts to compensate for the low calcium by increasing phosphate excretion).

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
