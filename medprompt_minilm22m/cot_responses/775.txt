## Step 1: Assess the situation and identify the key issues.
The patient has acute cholecystitis, which is confirmed by ultrasound findings of gallbladder thickening, sludging, and pericolic fat stranding. Additionally, a portion of the small intestine is found to be necrotic due to thromboembolism. The treatment involves additional surgery with small bowel resection and thromboendarterectomy.

## Step 2: Consider the patient's current condition and the importance of obtaining consent.
The patient is in acute distress (fever, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure) and has a significant medical condition that requires surgical intervention. Obtaining consent from the patient or his representative is crucial to ensure that the treatment aligns with their wishes.

## Step 3: Evaluate the options for obtaining consent.
Option A suggests decreasing the patient's sedation until he can give consent, which may not be feasible given the patient's current condition and the need for immediate surgical intervention. Option B proposes proceeding with additional surgery without obtaining consent, which is also not advisable due to the high risk of complications and potential harm to the patient. Option C recommends asking the patient's brother in the waiting room to consent, which may not be practical or effective given the distance between the patient and his representative.

## Step 4: Identify the most appropriate next step.
Option D suggests contacting the patient's healthcare power of attorney (POA) to obtain consent. This option is the most appropriate as it ensures that the treatment aligns with the patient's wishes, even if they are unable to give consent themselves due to their current condition.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
