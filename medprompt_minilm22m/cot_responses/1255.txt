## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation and laboratory results, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is severely altered and unable to answer questions about his medical history upon arrival at the emergency department. This suggests a significant alteration in mental status, which could be due to various causes including metabolic, toxic, or neurological conditions.

2. **Laboratory Results**:
   - pH of 7.32: This value indicates acidosis since normal blood pH ranges from 7.35 to 7.45.
   - pCO2 of 70 mmHg: This is lower than the normal range (35-45 mmHg), indicating respiratory alkalosis or a condition leading to hyperventilation.
   - Sodium bicarbonate level of 30 mg/dl: This value is significantly low, which could indicate a metabolic acidosis.

3. **Interpretation**:
   - The patient's severe alteration in mental status and the presence of acidosis (pH 7.32) suggest that the primary disturbance is related to an imbalance in acid-base balance.
   - The low sodium bicarbonate level further supports the diagnosis of a metabolic acidosis.

4. **Respiratory Acidosis vs. Respiratory Alkalosis**:
   - Respiratory alkalosis typically presents with a high pCO2 and low pH, which does not match our patient's profile.
   - Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a low pCO2 and high pH, which aligns with the provided ABG results.

5. **Mixed Alkalosis**: This condition would involve both respiratory alkalosis (low pCO2) and metabolic acidosis (high bicarbonate). However, given the patient's severe mental status and the specific laboratory values, it is less likely that mixed alkalosis is the primary disturbance.

**Conclusion**: Based on the clinical presentation of severe altered mental status and the ABG results showing a pH of 7.32 with low pCO2 and low sodium bicarbonate level, the most likely primary disturbance leading to these values is metabolic acidosis.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$
