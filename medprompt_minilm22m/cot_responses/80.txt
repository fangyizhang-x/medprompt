Given the clinical presentation of this newborn, which includes tachycardia and tachypnea with normal blood pressure, bluish discoloration (cyanosis) of the face and trunk, supraclavicular and intercostal retractions, a machine-like murmur over the precordium, and an abnormal finding on bedside echocardiography showing parallel circulation rather than in series, we can deduce that this newborn has Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), a congenital heart defect characterized by four specific features: ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta.

The key to managing TOF is to ensure adequate oxygenation. The patient's low oxygen saturation levels on pulse oximetry (79% in the right hand and 61% in the left foot) indicate hypoxemia, which can lead to tissue hypoxia if not addressed promptly.

Given that the blood pressure is within normal limits, we need to focus on improving cardiac output and increasing oxygen delivery to the tissues. The choice of pharmacotherapy should aim at reducing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), thereby decreasing the workload on the right ventricle and improving oxygenation.

A) Sildenafil: This is a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor used primarily in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). While it may help reduce PVR, it's not the first-line treatment for TOF.

B) Alprostadil: This is a prostaglandin E1 analog that can be administered via a catheter to increase blood flow through the ductus arteriosus in neonates with certain congenital heart defects. However, its use in TOF is limited due to potential side effects and the availability of more effective treatments.

C) Metoprolol: This beta-blocker is commonly used in the management of TOF to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance by decreasing the contractility of the right ventricle and the afterload on the left ventricle. It's a first-line treatment for reducing PVR and improving oxygenation in patients with TOF.

D) Indomethacin: This nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) is used to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, but it's not typically the first choice for managing TOF.

Therefore, considering the need to reduce PVR and improve
