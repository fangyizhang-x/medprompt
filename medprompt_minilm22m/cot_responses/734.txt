(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 2-year-old boy, we can deduce several key points that will help us determine the most likely outcome if left untreated.

Firstly, the patient has a history of recurrent respiratory infections, which suggests an underlying condition affecting his immune system or lung function. The presence of crackles in both lower lung fields on auscultation further supports this, as it indicates pulmonary congestion or edema, often seen in conditions like congenital heart disease.

The cardiac auscultation findings are particularly concerning: a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur over the left lower sternal border is indicative of mitral regurgitation (MR), which can be caused by various conditions including patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) or other congenital heart defects. The diastolic rumble heard best at the apex suggests a ventricular septal defect (VSD).

Given these findings, we need to consider what would happen if left untreated.

A. Thrombocytosis - This is not directly related to the clinical presentation described. While some conditions can lead to thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis, there's no indication of this in the scenario provided.

B. Secondary hypertension - While cardiac murmurs can be associated with secondary hypertension due to increased blood volume or cardiac output, this is not a direct consequence of untreated mitral regurgitation or VSD.

C. Aortic dissection - This is an extremely rare complication that would likely present with more severe symptoms and signs, such as sudden onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, or neurological deficits. It's not directly related to the described cardiac auscultation findings.

D. Digital clubbing - This condition is associated with chronic hypoxia, which can be caused by untreated congenital heart disease, including VSDs and PDA. The increased oxygen demand on the right side of the heart due to these defects can lead to pulmonary hypertension, which in turn causes cyanosis (a bluish discoloration of the skin) and digital clubbing.

Therefore, considering the clinical presentation and the potential consequences of untreated congenital heart disease, the most likely outcome is digital clubbing.
