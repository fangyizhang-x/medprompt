Given the patient's pre-operative evaluation, it is essential to consider both the current medical status and the risks associated with cataract surgery in a patient with diabetes, hypertension, and osteoarthritis.

Firstly, the patient's hemoglobin level (14.2 g/dL) is slightly below the normal range for adult males (13.5-17.5 g/dL), indicating mild anemia. However, this level does not seem to be a contraindication for surgery, as the patient has been advised to delay his surgery due to his osteoarthritis.

The INR of 1.2 is also within the normal range (1.0-3.0), suggesting that he is not at increased risk for bleeding complications related to anticoagulation therapy.

Regarding the hemoglobin A1c level of 6.9%, it indicates that the patient has been on metformin for an extended period, which can affect glucose metabolism and potentially impact surgical outcomes. However, this level does not appear to be a significant concern in terms of anesthesia or surgery-related risks.

The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits (130/70 mmHg), and his pulse rate is slightly elevated but still within the normal range for an adult male (80 beats per minute). These findings do not suggest any immediate cardiovascular risk factors that would contraindicate surgery.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate course of action at this time is to medically clear the patient for surgery. This decision is based on the fact that the patient's current medical status and laboratory results do not appear to pose a significant risk for anesthesia or surgical complications.

Performing an EKG (B) might be considered if there were concerns about cardiac function, but it is not necessary given the information provided. Scheduling the patient for a stress test and asking him to delay surgery for at least 6 months (C) would be overly cautious and may not be justified based on the current pre-operative evaluation.

Finally, telling the patient he will have to delay his surgery for at least 1 year (D) is an unrealistic and potentially harmful approach. Delaying surgery for such a long period could lead to significant delays in addressing other necessary medical conditions that require prompt attention.

Therefore, the most appropriate course of action is to medically clear the patient for surgery based on his current pre-operative evaluation.
