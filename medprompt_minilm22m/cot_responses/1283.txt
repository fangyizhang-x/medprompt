## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 11-year-old African American boy, we can deduce several key points:

1. **Severe hip pain** that is exacerbated by passive movement and tenderness on palpation but not by active movement.
2. **Pale conjunctivae**, which suggests anemia or a hemolytic process.
3. **Hematocrit of 25%**, indicating severe anemia.
4. **Leukocyte count of 14,000/mm^3**, which is elevated and could indicate infection, inflammation, or a hematological disorder.
5. **Peripheral blood smear** findings are crucial for this question.

Considering the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, we can rule out some options:

- **A. Trophozoites**: These are typically seen in malaria, which is not indicated by the provided information (e.g., no chills or sweats).
- **B. Decreased number of thrombocytes**: This would suggest a coagulopathy, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support this.
- **D. Gram-negative bacilli**: These are typically seen in infections such as pneumonia or sepsis, which is not indicated by the provided information.

This leaves us with:

**C. Howell-Jolly bodies**: These are small, round inclusions within red blood cells that can be seen on a peripheral blood smear when there is a significant number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in the sample. Neutropenia or severe anemia can lead to Howell-Jolly body formation.

Given the patient's history of similar painful episodes requiring multiple hospitalizations, it is likely that he has had recurrent infections or inflammation, which could be due to a hematological disorder such as sickle cell disease (SCD), given his African American background. SCD is characterized by anemia, leukopenia (low white blood cell count), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). The presence of Howell-Jolly bodies on the peripheral blood smear would support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely finding on a peripheral blood smear in this patient would be **C. Howell-Jolly bodies**.
