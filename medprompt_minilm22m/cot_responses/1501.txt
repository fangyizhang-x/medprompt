## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and history, let's break down the key points:

1. **Right-sided facial weakness**: This suggests a problem with the motor neurons controlling the muscles of the face.
2. **Neck pain and headache after hunting trip**: This could be related to a viral infection or another condition that triggered an inflammatory response.
3. **Ibuprofen relief, followed by worsening symptoms**: Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can cause headaches and other side effects when taken in high doses or for extended periods.
4. **5-year history of hypertension**: While important, this doesn't directly relate to the current symptoms.
5. **Smoking and alcohol use**: Both are risk factors for various health issues, but they don't directly explain the facial weakness.

Considering these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the facial skin**: This test is used to detect viral infections such as herpes simplex or varicella-zoster virus, which could cause facial weakness and other symptoms like neck pain and headache. Given the patient's recent hunting trip, where he was exposed to various wildlife, a viral infection is a plausible explanation.

B. **Cerebrospinal fluid analysis**: This test would be more appropriate if the patient had symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis, which are not mentioned in the scenario.

C. **Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)**: This test is used to detect antibodies against various pathogens, including viruses and bacteria. While it could be relevant, there's no indication that the patient has an active infection.

D. **Noncontrast CT**: This imaging test would be useful for evaluating structural abnormalities in the brain or spine, but it doesn't directly explain the facial weakness or neck pain.

Given the information provided, the most likely explanation is a viral infection, and PCR of the facial skin is the most appropriate next step to investigate this possibility.
