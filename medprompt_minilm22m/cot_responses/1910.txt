## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and travel history, we can deduce that she is likely infected with a norovirus, which is a common cause of gastroenteritis in travelers.

The key points to consider are:

1. The patient returned from a trip to the Caribbean, where norovirus outbreaks have been reported.
2. She had close contact with an infant who had caught a cold at daycare, suggesting that she may have been exposed to a virus through contaminated food or water.
3. Despite trying to avoid uncooked food and unpeeled fruits, which are common sources of norovirus transmission, her symptoms suggest that the virus was not acquired from these sources.

Given this information, we can rule out options A (Linear dsRNA virus) and B (ssDNA virus), as noroviruses are RNA viruses. Option D (-) ssRNA virus is also incorrect, as noroviruses are indeed positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses.

This leaves us with option C (+) ssRNA virus, which is the correct answer. Norovirus infections are typically characterized by a high fever, watery diarrhea, and vomiting, which are consistent with the patient's symptoms. The fact that her stool culture was negative for bacteria does not rule out norovirus infection, as the virus can be shed in the feces without causing significant bacterial contamination.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's illness is a norovirus infection, which is characterized by a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome.
