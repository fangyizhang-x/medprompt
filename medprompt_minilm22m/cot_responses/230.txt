## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history of a recent injury to his hand, which has progressed to an ulcerative and necrotic lesion on his right shoulder, we can deduce that the most likely pattern of this patientâ€™s skin lesions is related to a hematogenous dissemination. Here's why:

1. **Recent injury**: The patient's injury occurred while he was weeding his shrubs, which suggests that there may have been some trauma or irritation to the skin.
2. **Ulcerative and necrotic lesion**: The description of the initial lesion as "necrotic and ulcerative" indicates a severe inflammatory response, which is consistent with an infection or a reaction to an external agent.
3. **Progression from hand to shoulder**: While it's possible that the lesions could have spread through lymphatic channels (option D), the fact that they started on the patient's right hand and then progressed to his shoulder suggests a hematogenous dissemination, where the infection or toxin is carried away from the initial site by the bloodstream.
4. **Absence of respiratory or meningeal disease**: The patient denies symptoms of these conditions, which makes it less likely that the lesions are related to an infectious process affecting the lungs (option B) or the central nervous system (option C).

Therefore, based on the patient's history and the characteristics of his skin lesions, the most likely pattern is hematogenous dissemination, where the infection or toxin is carried away from the initial site by the bloodstream.

The other options are less likely:

* Contact dermatitis (A) typically presents with a localized reaction to an external agent, such as a chemical or allergen.
* Dermatophyte colonization (C) refers to the growth of fungi on the skin, which would not explain the patient's symptoms or the progression of the lesions.
* Ascending lymphangitis (D) is inflammation of the lymphatic vessels that can be caused by infection or injury. While it could potentially spread from the initial site, the fact that the lesions started on the patient's right hand and then progressed to his shoulder makes this option less likely.
