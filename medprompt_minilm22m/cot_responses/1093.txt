## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, let's break down the key points:

1. **Sustained sensation of the room spinning**: This suggests a vestibular component to his symptoms.
2. **Occasional nausea and diphenhydramine use**: While these can contribute to vertigo, they don't fully explain the sustained nature of the symptom.
3. **Recent garlic consumption**: Garlic is known for its potential to exacerbate or trigger vertigo in some individuals.
4. **Physical exam findings**:
   - The patient's head being turned slightly to the right and laid back flat rapidly does not provoke symptoms, suggesting a positional component.
   - A nystagmus (abnormal eye movements) on cranial nerve exam is notable, which supports a vestibular issue.
   - Bilateral decreased hearing could be related to the vertigo or contribute to the patient's overall presentation.

Considering these points:

- **Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)**: This condition typically involves brief episodes of vertigo triggered by specific head movements, which doesn't fully explain the sustained nature of the symptoms.
- **Labyrinthitis**: An inner ear infection that can cause vertigo and hearing loss. However, it's less likely given the patient's recent garlic consumption and lack of other symptoms like fever or headache.
- **Vertebrobasilar Stroke**: This condition affects the vertebrae and basilar artery, which could lead to a wide range of neurological symptoms, including vertigo. However, the physical exam findings don't strongly support this diagnosis.
- **Vestibular Neuritis**: An inflammation of the vestibular nerve that can cause sudden onset of vertigo, often triggered by head movements or changes in position. The patient's recent garlic consumption and the presence of nystagmus on cranial nerve exam are consistent with this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the combination of sustained vertigo, positional vertigo-like symptoms, and nystagmus, **Vestibular Neuritis** is the most likely diagnosis.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
