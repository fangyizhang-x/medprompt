(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The clinical presentation of this 8-month-old boy, including crying in the mother's arms, distended abdomen with tympany in the left lower quadrant, and intensification of crying upon palpation of the abdomen, is highly suggestive of Hirschsprung disease.

Firstly, the failure of specialized cells to migrate during embryonic development (neurogenesis) leads to the absence or abnormal development of ganglion cells in the distal bowel. This results in a functional obstruction of the colon due to the accumulation of stool behind the affected segment.

The key findings that support this diagnosis include:

1. The boy's symptoms, such as crying and abdominal distension, are consistent with intestinal obstruction.
2. The absence of cyanosis, which would suggest a problem with oxygenation or cardiac function, is not present in this case.
3. Normal cardiac examination limits the differential diagnosis for cardiac causes of obstruction.

The physical examination findings, including the presence of tympany (a high-pitched sound) in the left lower quadrant, are also consistent with intestinal obstruction and suggest that the distal bowel is filled with fluid or gas.

In contrast, Meckel diverticulum typically presents with a palpable mass in the right upper quadrant, DiGeorge syndrome involves multiple congenital anomalies including heart defects, and Duodenal atresia involves a complete obstruction of the duodenum.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is Hirschsprung disease.
