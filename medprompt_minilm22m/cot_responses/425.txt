## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Initial Assessment and Differential Diagnosis
The patient presents with fatigue, lethargy, lower leg swelling, darker urine, and a history of recent weight loss. These symptoms, combined with laboratory findings such as elevated creatinine and RBC casts in the urine, suggest nephrotic syndrome. The presence of pretibial edema further supports this diagnosis.

### Differential Diagnosis
Given the patient's age (25 years) and the presence of renal biopsy showing crescent formation and extracapillary cell proliferation, a primary glomerulonephritis such as post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), membranous nephropathy, or minimal change disease is less likely. However, PSGN can be considered given the patient's age and the presence of crescent formation.

### Laboratory Findings
The laboratory findings are consistent with nephrotic syndrome, including low serum albumin, high levels of proteinuria (3+), and elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. The presence of RBC casts in the urine further supports this diagnosis.

### Management Options
Considering the patient's age and the need to manage a potentially severe condition such as PSGN or minimal change disease, which can have significant morbidity if not properly managed, the most appropriate next step would be to initiate immunosuppressive therapy. Among the options provided:

- **A. Administer rituximab**: Rituximab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is not typically used for nephrotic syndrome.
  
- **B. Administer lisinopril**: Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which can be used in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome to reduce proteinuria and slow disease progression. However, it may not be sufficient on its own for severe cases.

- **C. Administer methylprednisolone**: Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid that can be used as an initial treatment for acute exacerbations of nephrotic syndrome or to reduce inflammation in more chronic cases. It is often the first-line treatment for PSGN, which could be considered given the patient's age and symptoms.

- **D. Administer cyclosporine A**: Cyclosporine
