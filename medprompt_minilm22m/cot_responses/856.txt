## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To address this question, let's break down the key components and analyze them step by step:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with altered taste, a gritty sensation in her eyes (dryness), frequent need to drink water, dry mouth, and throat. These symptoms are characteristic of sicca syndrome.

2. **Sicca Syndrome**: Sicca syndrome is characterized by xerostomia (dry mouth) and xerophthalmia (dry eyes). The condition can be caused by various factors including autoimmune disorders, medications, and certain medical conditions that affect salivary gland function or the nerves controlling salivation.

3. **Treatment Goal**: The goal of treatment in sicca syndrome is to improve symptoms related to dryness of mouth by increasing salivation.

4. **Mechanism of Action for Saliva-Enhancing Medications**:
   - **Muscarinic Receptors**: These are part of the parasympathetic nervous system and play a crucial role in regulating salivary gland secretion.
   - **Antagonists vs. Agonists**: Antagonists block muscarinic receptors, while agonists activate them.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - A. Selective M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist: These are primarily involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction and are not directly associated with increasing salivation.
   - B. Selective M2 muscarinic receptor agonist: These can stimulate salivary gland secretion, which is beneficial for patients with sicca syndrome.
   - C. Selective M2 muscarinic receptor antagonist: This would decrease salivation rather than increase it.
   - D. Selective M3 muscarinic receptor agonist: While these receptors are involved in various physiological processes, they are not primarily associated with increasing salivation.

6. **Conclusion**: Given the need to enhance salivation and considering the role of muscarinic receptors in regulating salivary gland secretion, the most likely mechanism of action for a drug prescribed to this patient is to stimulate muscarinic receptors, which would increase salivation.

The final answer is: B
