## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of depression, irritability, withdrawal, and sudden jerky movements, along with his family history of hypertension but no other significant medical conditions or personal history that would suggest a specific diagnosis like dementia or Parkinson's disease, we can consider several potential causes for these symptoms.

Firstly, the patient's recent onset of changes in mood and tearfulness could be indicative of depression. However, the presence of sudden jerky movements (akinesia) is particularly suggestive of Parkinson's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. The fact that the patient has never smoked or been exposed to environmental toxins that are known risk factors for Parkinson's disease makes this diagnosis more plausible.

The physical exam findings of flat affect and facial grimace with sudden jerky movements further support the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. These symptoms, combined with the patient's history of depression, make it less likely that his condition is simply a manifestation of depression or another psychiatric disorder.

Regarding the potential answers:

A. Positive 14-3-3 CSF assay: This test is typically used to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease. While it may be positive in some cases of Parkinson's disease, this would not be the most likely initial finding given the patient's symptoms.

B. Alpha-synuclein aggregates on brain biopsy: This is a diagnostic test for Parkinson's disease, but it is typically performed after other tests have been ruled out and before any surgical interventions are considered.

C. Neurofibrillary tangles on brain biopsy: These are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, which does not fit with the patient's presentation of sudden jerky movements and depression.

D. Dorsal striatum atrophy on head CT: This is a common finding in Parkinson's disease due to the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. It can be seen on a head CT scan, especially if there are other signs of brain atrophy or damage.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the most likely next step in further workup would be to perform a head CT scan to evaluate for dorsal striatum atrophy, which is consistent with Parkinson's disease.
