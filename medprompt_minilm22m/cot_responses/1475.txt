## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key elements and analyze them step by step:

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is 72 years old with a history of diabetes mellitus, two myocardial infarctions leading to significant cardiac dysfunction (dyspnea, peripheral edema), and occasional decompensation into more severe pulmonary edema.

2. **Symptoms**: Mild discomfort in the eyes without any change in vision.

3. **Medications Prescribed**: Several medications for increased intra-ocular pressure are prescribed by the ophthalmologist.

4. **Potential Medications**:
   - **A. It decreases intracellular cyclic AMP levels**: This is characteristic of beta-blockers, which decrease heart rate and contractility, potentially worsening cardiac dysfunction.
   - **B. It increases intracellular calcium levels**: This is characteristic of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), which can help reduce intra-ocular pressure by relaxing smooth muscle in the eye.
   - **C. It increases adenylyl cyclase activity**: This is characteristic of prostaglandin analogs, which increase intra-ocular pressure by causing aqueous humor to be produced and maintained in the eye.
   - **D. It is produced by cyclooxygenase**: This is characteristic of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can affect various bodily functions but are not typically associated with increased intra-ocular pressure.

Given the patient's history of cardiac dysfunction, dyspnea, and peripheral edema, medications that could exacerbate these conditions or worsen his overall health status would be contraindicated. Beta-blockers (Option A) decrease heart rate and contractility, which can worsen cardiac function in this patient. Calcium channel blockers (Option C) are generally safe for patients with cardiovascular disease but may not be the most concerning option given the context of increased intra-ocular pressure.

Therefore, the medication that is most likely to be contraindicated in this patient has characteristics that would exacerbate his existing conditions or worsen his cardiac function. The best answer is A.
