(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's diagnosis of estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor negative, HER2-receptor positive invasive ductal carcinoma with a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy, we can proceed to discuss the appropriate pharmacotherapy for this type of breast cancer.

Firstly, considering the patient's hormone receptor status (ER/PR negative), her treatment options would typically include targeted therapy or chemotherapy. However, since she is HER2-receptor positive, which is often associated with more aggressive disease and poorer prognosis, we need to consider additional treatments that can address both estrogen receptor negativity and HER2 overexpression.

Among the provided options:

- **A. Echocardiography**: This test is not directly relevant to breast cancer treatment or management.
- **B. Fundoscopy**: While fundoscopy may be part of a comprehensive eye examination, it is not an appropriate next step in managing this patient's breast cancer.
- **C. X-ray of the chest**: Given that there are no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy and negative sentinel lymph node biopsy, further imaging to assess for metastatic disease or to evaluate the extent of disease spread would be premature without additional evidence.
- **D. Endometrial biopsy**: This is the most appropriate next step in management. The patient's hormone receptor status (ER/PR negative) suggests that her uterus may still be at risk for endometrial cancer, and an endometrial biopsy can help assess for any potential precancerous or malignant changes.

Therefore, before initiating systemic therapy, it is essential to confirm the absence of endometrial cancer in this patient. An endometrial biopsy will provide valuable information regarding her risk profile and guide further management decisions.

The final answer is: D
