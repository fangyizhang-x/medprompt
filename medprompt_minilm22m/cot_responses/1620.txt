## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's presentation with rectal bleeding, particularly given his family history of colorectal cancer at a young age, raises concerns about hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome. This condition is characterized by an increased risk of developing certain types of colorectal cancer and other cancers, such as endometrial, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer.

Given the patient's age and the presence of numerous adenomas in the colon, which are a hallmark of HNPCC, we can rule out option A (mutation in DNA mismatch repair genes) as it is more commonly associated with microsatellite instability (MSI-H), not typically seen in this scenario. Similarly, option C (inactivation of RB1 gene) is more closely associated with retinoblastoma and other cancers.

Option D (inactivation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes) is also less likely as it is primarily associated with breast and ovarian cancer, although there can be an increased risk of other cancers. The patient's presentation does not suggest a strong family history of these cancers.

Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's illness is mutations in the APC gene, which is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a critical role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. Mutations in the APC gene can lead to the development of adenomas and colorectal cancer, as seen in this patient.

The presence of numerous adenomas in the colon, particularly in an individual with no further information about their family history, supports the diagnosis of HNPCC (Lynch syndrome). This condition is characterized by a germline mutation in one of the APC, KRAS, or SMAD4 genes, leading to the accumulation of genetic mutations that disrupt normal cellular function and lead to cancer.
