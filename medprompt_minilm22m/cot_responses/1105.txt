Given the patient's presentation, including shortness of breath, inability to string a sentence together, narrow-complex tachycardia with irregular P waves preceding each QRS complex and irregular PR intervals on EKG, we need to consider the potential causes of his symptoms. The fact that he has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) makes him more susceptible to arrhythmias.

The patient's inability to breathe and shortness of breath are classic symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can be caused by various factors including pneumonia, sepsis, or other conditions leading to hypoxia. The narrow-complex tachycardia with irregular P waves preceding each QRS complex is a hallmark electrocardiographic finding in ARDS.

Given the patient's history of COPD and his current presentation, it is essential to consider the potential for acute respiratory failure as a cause of his symptoms. The narrow-complex tachycardia could be indicative of hypoxemia or other cardiac causes that are contributing to his respiratory distress.

The best next step in management should aim to stabilize the patient's oxygenation and ensure adequate perfusion of vital organs. Given the patient's inability to breathe, intubation is likely necessary to secure his airway and provide mechanical ventilation if needed. Additionally, monitoring for signs of cardiac decompensation or other complications such as hypotension or acidosis should be considered.

Option A (Obtain chemistries and complete blood count and observe) may not be sufficient given the patient's unstable condition and the need for immediate intervention to address his respiratory distress and potential cardiac causes. Option B (Give labetalol immediately and observe in emergency room) is also premature without further diagnostic information, as labetalol may not be the best initial choice for managing acute ARDS.

Option C (Give oxygen immediately) is appropriate but does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. While supplemental oxygen may be necessary to improve his oxygen saturation, it does not treat the potential cardiac causes that need to be addressed.

Therefore, Option D (Intubate and admit to intensive care unit) is the most appropriate next step in management, as it addresses both the respiratory and cardiac components of the patient's presentation. This will allow for further monitoring and management of his condition, including potential interventions such as mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or other medications that may be necessary to stabilize him
