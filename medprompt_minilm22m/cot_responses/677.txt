(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation with a moderate to severe headache that started acutely, is bilateral, throbbing in nature, and located in the occipital region bilaterally, along with mild photophobia, the most likely diagnosis is a tension-type headache. The fact that she has had similar headaches in the past month also supports this possibility.

The presence of moderate tenderness to palpation diffusely over the upper posterior cervical muscles and occipital region of the scalp further supports the diagnosis of a tension-type headache. This physical examination finding is consistent with the mechanism of action of triptans, which are commonly used for the treatment of tension-type headaches.

Given the patient's age (42 years) and her occupation as a corporate attorney, who likely spends long hours sitting or standing, it is also reasonable to consider other potential causes of headache, such as migraines. However, given the acute onset and bilateral nature of this headache, tension-type headache is more likely.

The use of ibuprofen 200 mg orally and sumatriptan 6 mg subcutaneously (C) would be appropriate for the treatment of a tension-type headache. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which can help to reduce inflammation and relieve pain, while sumatriptan is a serotonin receptor agonist that is specifically used for the treatment of migraines but can also be effective for tension-type headaches.

The use of a non-contrast CT of the head and neck (A) would not be indicated at this time as there are no specific findings on physical examination or laboratory tests that suggest an acute hemorrhage, stroke, or other serious condition that would require immediate imaging. The review of systems is significant for mild photophobia, but there are no other concerning symptoms.

The use of a T1/T2 MRI of the head and neck (B) may be considered in certain cases where there are concerns about structural abnormalities or complications such as subarachnoid hemorrhage or epidural hematoma. However, given the patient's age and the lack of specific findings on physical examination or laboratory tests that would suggest a more serious condition, this is not the most appropriate next step.

The use of lifestyle changes, relaxation techniques, and massage therapy (D) may be beneficial for some patients with tension-type headaches but are unlikely to provide relief in this case given the patient's age and the acute onset of her
