## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To solve this question, let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Fertilization begins when sperm binds to the corona radiata of the egg**: This is a crucial initial step in fertilization. The corona radiata is a layer of cells surrounding the egg that provides nutrients and support.

2. **Once the sperm enters the cytoplasm, a cortical reaction occurs which prevents other sperm from entering the oocyte**: Cortical reactions are a series of cellular changes that occur when an egg is fertilized by a sperm. These reactions help to prevent polyspermy (the fusion of multiple sperm into one cell) and ensure that only one sperm can fertilize the egg.

3. **The next reaction that is necessary for fertilization to continue**: Given the context, we're looking for a reaction that occurs after the cortical reaction has prevented other sperm from entering the oocyte. This suggests that we need to consider reactions that are involved in the process of fertilization itself, rather than those that occur before or during the initial binding.

4. **Options analysis**:
   - A. Release of a polar body: While this is an important step in the development of many cells (e.g., meiosis I), it's not directly related to the continuation of fertilization.
   - B. Degeneration of the sperm tail: This would actually be a negative reaction, as it would prevent the sperm from continuing to fertilize the egg.
   - C. Acrosome reaction: This is the next step in the process after the initial binding between the sperm and the egg's outer layer (corona radiata). The acrosome reaction involves the release of enzymes from the sperm that help break down the egg's outer layers, allowing the sperm to penetrate.
   - D. The second meiotic division: This is not a necessary step for fertilization to continue. Meiosis I has already occurred when the sperm binds to the egg.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the correct answer is **C. Acrosome reaction**, as it is the next critical step in the process of fertilization after the initial binding between the sperm and the egg's outer layer.
