## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of intermittent sharp right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, mild scleral icterus (indicative of jaundice), and laboratory findings including elevated alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin levels, the most likely diagnosis is cholestasis. The patient's symptoms and lab results are consistent with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), which are both causes of chronic cholestasis.

The next step in diagnosis should aim to further characterize the nature of the cholestasis, particularly if it is suspected to be PBC. ERCP (A) might be useful for diagnosing and treating bile duct stones or strictures but is not typically used as a first-line diagnostic tool for cholestatic jaundice.

The HIDA scan (B) can help assess the function of the biliary system, particularly in cases where there are obstructive causes of cholestasis. However, it may not provide detailed information about the nature of the obstruction or the extent of bile duct damage.

Supine and erect X-rays of the abdomen (C) might show some signs suggestive of liver disease, such as an enlarged liver or ascites, but they would not be sensitive enough to diagnose cholestasis specifically.

Transabdominal ultrasonography (D) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can provide detailed images of the liver and bile ducts. It is particularly useful for evaluating the gallbladder, bile ducts, and liver parenchyma, making it an excellent choice for assessing the extent of cholestasis.

Therefore, considering the need to further characterize the nature of the cholestasis in this patient, transabdominal ultrasonography would be the most appropriate next step in diagnosis.
