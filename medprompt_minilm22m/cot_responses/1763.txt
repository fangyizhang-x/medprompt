## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can deduce that this is a case of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack.

The sharp, substernal chest pain worsened by inspiration and improved when leaning forward are classic symptoms of AMI. The fact that it occurs on the left side of the chest also suggests that the affected area is likely located in the anterior wall of the left ventricle.

The cardiac examination finding of a scratchy sound best heard over the left sternal border further supports this diagnosis, as this type of sound is typically associated with pericardial friction rubs, which are often heard in patients with AMI due to inflammation and fibrosis of the pericardium.

Histopathological examination of the affected tissue would likely show evidence of acute myocardial infarction. The most common finding in AMI is coagulative necrosis, characterized by the death of cardiac muscle cells (myocytes) that are tightly packed together in a organized manner. This type of cell death leads to the characteristic "chicken wire" appearance under microscopic examination.

The other options can be eliminated based on the following reasoning:

A. Neutrophilic infiltration is more commonly associated with bacterial endocarditis or acute bacterial pericarditis, which typically present with different clinical and physical examination findings.

B. Coagulative necrosis is a hallmark of AMI, but it's not specific to this condition alone. Other conditions like myocardial infarction due to coronary artery disease (CAD) can also cause coagulative necrosis.

D. Granulation tissue with macrophages is more characteristic of chronic inflammation and healing processes, such as in the case of atherosclerotic plaque rupture leading to acute thrombosis or embolism.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and the typical histopathological changes associated with AMI, the most likely finding in this patient is coagulative necrosis.
