(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's long-standing history of acne, despite previous attempts at topical treatments and supplements, the presence of numerous nodulocystic lesions with scarring suggests that the current condition is more severe than initially thought. The fact that the acne has worsened over time indicates a possible progression to more severe forms of acne, such as cystic acne or even nodular acne.

The patient's concern about his appearance and the presence of multiple lesions on different parts of the body (face, neck, shoulders, and upper back) further supports the need for aggressive treatment. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends a comprehensive approach to treating severe acne, which includes oral antibiotics as part of a systemic treatment plan.

Considering the severity of the patient's condition, option B (Oral isotretinoin) is the most appropriate treatment option at this time. Isotretinoin is a powerful oral retinoid that has been shown to be effective in treating severe acne, including nodulocystic acne with significant scarring. It works by reducing inflammation and preventing clogged pores, which can help to clear up the lesions.

Oral erythromycin (option A) may not be sufficient for this patient's condition due to its limited ability to penetrate into deep-seated cysts and nodules. Topical isotretinoin (option C) is unlikely to be effective in treating severe acne with significant scarring, as it primarily targets the surface of the skin.

Topical salicylic acid (option D) may help to reduce inflammation and prevent clogged pores, but it is not sufficient on its own for treating severe acne with significant scarring. While it can be used as a component of a topical treatment regimen, it should not be relied upon as the sole treatment option.

Therefore, the most appropriate treatment option for this patient at this time is oral isotretinoin.
