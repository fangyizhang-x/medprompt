## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's presentation and laboratory results suggest that her hypoglycemia is likely due to an excess of glucagon, which is a hormone produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas. The key points in this case are:

1. **Symptoms**: Palpitations, sweating, blurry vision, and episodes of palpitations occur after physical activity, particularly volleyball playing on the beach. These symptoms are consistent with hypoglycemia.
2. **Blood glucose level**: A fingerstick blood glucose level of 45 mg/dL is significantly below the normal range (typically < 70 mg/dL).
3. **Serum insulin and proinsulin levels**: The serum insulin level is low (< 6 microU/L), which suggests that insulin production is impaired, but the proinsulin level is also low (< 20% of total insulin). This pattern is consistent with a deficiency in insulin secretion.
4. **C-peptide level**: A c-peptide level of 0.8 nmol/L is significantly below the normal range (typically > 1-2 nmol/L), indicating that the body is not producing enough insulin to stimulate glucagon release.

Given these findings, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Heat stroke**: Heat stroke would more likely present with symptoms such as confusion, altered mental status, and changes in blood pressure, which are not mentioned in this case.

B. **Exogenous insulin**: Administering exogenous insulin would increase serum insulin levels, which is not consistent with the low insulin level observed in this patient.

C. **Beta cell tumor of the pancreas**: A beta-cell tumor would likely result in an excess of glucagon production, leading to hypoglycemia. This option is consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

D. **Alpha cell tumor of the pancreas**: An alpha-cell tumor would also produce excess glucagon, leading to hypoglycemia. However, this option is less likely than a beta-cell tumor, given the normal serum insulin level.

Therefore, based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results, the most likely cause of her hypoglycemia is an **alpha cell tumor of the pancreas**.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
