## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, we can deduce that she likely has Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT), a rare genetic disorder characterized by abdominal pain, neurological symptoms, and photosensitivity.

The elevated concentrations of porphobilinogen and Î´-aminolevulinic acid in serum studies are indicative of PCT. These substances are precursors to the production of heme, which is normally broken down in the liver. In PCT, the breakdown process is impaired, leading to their accumulation.

PCT can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition. The patient's mother and maternal uncle also have similar symptoms, suggesting a possible genetic component to the disease.

The patient's husband being healthy and there being no history of serious illness in his family does not rule out PCT, as it can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

Given this information, we can estimate the probability of the patient having a child with the same disease as her. Assuming that the condition is autosomal dominant, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene from their mother and a 50% chance of inheriting it from their father.

Since the patient's husband is healthy, he does not contribute to the risk of passing on the mutated gene to his children. Therefore, the probability that one or both of her children will inherit the mutated gene and develop PCT is:

* 50% (mother) x 100% (father) = 50%
* 25% (mother) x 50% (father) = 12.5%

Adding these probabilities together gives us a total probability of approximately 62.5%. However, this is not among the answer choices.

Given that PCT can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and considering the patient's family history, it is more likely that she will pass on her mutated gene to one or both of her children. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of having a child with the same disease as her to be around 50%, but this is not explicitly listed among the answer choices.

However, since we are looking for an option and given the closest approximation:

The final answer is $\boxed{B}$
