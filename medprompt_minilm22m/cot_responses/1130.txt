## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Firstly, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

- Diarrhea and vomiting with loose, watery stools and partially digested food particles indicate a gastrointestinal infection or inflammation.
- The absence of blood or mucus in the stool suggests that the cause is likely an infectious agent rather than a structural problem like a kidney stone.
- The patient's inability to tolerate fluids further supports this suspicion, as dehydration can exacerbate symptoms.

Given these findings, we can infer that the patient has acute nephritis, which is inflammation of the kidneys. This condition is often caused by infections such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), but in this case, it seems more likely related to a systemic infection or another cause.

Now, let's consider the physiologic changes expected in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and filtration fraction (FF):

- GFR is the volume of fluid filtered from the renal glomeruli into the Bowman's capsule per unit time. In acute nephritis, the GFR is typically decreased due to inflammation and damage to the glomeruli.
- RPF is the rate at which plasma flows through the kidneys. It can be affected by various factors, including dehydration, but in this case, it might not be directly related to the primary issue of acute nephritis.
- FF is the fraction of filtered fluid that is excreted into the urine. In acute nephritis, the FF is typically decreased due to inflammation and damage to the glomeruli.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can expect:

The final answer is: B
