## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

This study is an example of a **Prospective Cohort Study**.

Here's why:

- The study starts with the current population (i.e., "next year") and follows them over time to assess changes in patient satisfaction.
- It does not start with a defined cohort or group, nor does it compare two groups at different times. Instead, it observes the same individuals over an extended period.

In contrast:

- **Cross-sectional study** involves observing a defined population at a single point in time (e.g., "next year").
- **Prospective case-control** and **Retrospective case-control** studies involve comparing cases (those with a specific outcome) to controls (those without the outcome), often at different times.

Therefore, this study design is best described as a Prospective Cohort Study.
