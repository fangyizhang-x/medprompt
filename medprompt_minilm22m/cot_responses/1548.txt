Given the clinical presentation of a 13-month-old boy with sickle cell anemia who is experiencing severe left-hand swelling and has not responded to diclofenac syrup, the most appropriate initial step in management would be to perform a joint aspiration. Here's why:

1. **Sickle Cell Anemia and Joint Swelling**: Sickle cell disease can cause chronic pain crises, including joint pain, due to sickling of red blood cells within the joints. The swelling and tenderness described are consistent with this diagnosis.

2. **Ineffective Pain Management**: The child has been given diclofenac syrup without relief, which is a common first-line treatment for acute musculoskeletal pain in children with sickle cell disease. However, diclofenac can have gastrointestinal side effects, and it may not be effective in all cases of joint pain.

3. **Joint Aspiration**: This procedure involves withdrawing fluid from the joint to assess its composition and identify any abnormalities that could be contributing to the child's symptoms. It is a non-invasive, relatively safe procedure that can provide valuable information about the joint condition without causing significant harm or discomfort to the child.

4. **Other Options**:
   - **Intravenous Morphine**: While morphine may provide some relief from pain, it is not typically used as an initial treatment for acute musculoskeletal pain in children with sickle cell disease due to its potential side effects and the availability of more effective treatments.
   - **Incentive Spirometry**: This test measures lung function and is not relevant to the management of joint swelling or pain in this context.
   - **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Affected Joint**: While MRI can provide detailed images of soft tissue, it is not typically used as an initial diagnostic tool for acute musculoskeletal pain in children with sickle cell disease. It may be considered later in the diagnosis process if other tests are inconclusive or if there are concerns about joint damage.

In conclusion, given the clinical presentation and the need to quickly identify and manage potential causes of joint swelling in a child with sickle cell anemia, joint aspiration is the best initial step in management.
