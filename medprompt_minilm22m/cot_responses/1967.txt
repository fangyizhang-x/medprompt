## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The study described is an ecological study, specifically a case-control study.

- The investigators examined per capita income and rates of syphilis in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston.
- This suggests that the researchers are looking at the relationship between two variables (per capita income and syphilis rates) to identify potential associations or correlations.
- However, the fact that they found a higher number of new cases of syphilis was higher in low-income neighborhoods implies that the relationship is not causal but rather observational. This is characteristic of an ecological study.

In particular, this type of study is known as a case-control study because it involves comparing individuals with a specific outcome (cases) to those without the outcome (controls), looking back in time to identify potential exposures or risk factors. However, since the question mentions that the investigators found a higher number of new cases was higher in low-income neighborhoods, this suggests an ecological study rather than a case-control study.

Therefore, the answer is B. Ecological study.
