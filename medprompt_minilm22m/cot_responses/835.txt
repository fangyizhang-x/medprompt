## Answer
To approach this question, let's first identify the key elements provided:

1. The patient is a 65-year-old man with a well-managed condition (feeling well).
2. His pulse is 80/min and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg.
3. There's a holosystolic murmur in the 4th intercostal space along the left sternal border that gets louder during inspiration.

Given these details, we need to understand what the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings indicate about his cardiovascular system.

- The presence of a holosystolic murmur is characteristic of mitral regurgitation (MR), where blood flows backward from the left ventricle into the left atrium during systole.
- The fact that the murmur gets louder during inspiration suggests that it's related to respiration, which increases venous return to the heart.

Now, let's consider the hemodynamic changes listed in the options:

A. Increased peripheral vascular resistance would decrease cardiac output and increase blood pressure, but it wouldn't directly explain why the murmur is louder during inspiration.

B. Increased right ventricular stroke volume could contribute to a holosystolic murmur by increasing the volume of blood flowing back into the left atrium, but this doesn't directly address why the murmur gets louder with inspiration.

C. Decreased left ventricular venous return would lead to increased pressure in the left atrium and subsequently increase the volume of blood regurgitating through the mitral valve, making option B a more plausible explanation for the louder murmur during inspiration.

D. Increased systemic venous compliance would decrease the pressure gradient across the mitral valve, potentially reducing the severity of the holosystolic murmur but not explaining why it's louder with inspiration.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely hemodynamic change that explains the increase in the patient's murmur is decreased left ventricular venous return.
