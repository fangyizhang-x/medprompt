## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history and current clinical presentation, we can deduce several key points that will help us narrow down the molecular profile:

1. **Family History**: The patient's mother died at 42 years old due to breast cancer, which is a significant risk factor for her daughter. This suggests a possible genetic predisposition.

2. **Age and Presentation**: At 39 years old with a hard, rock-like mass, irregular borders, erythema, dimpling of the skin, ipsilateral mobile axillary lymphadenopathy, and metastatic lesions in multiple organs (brain, liver, supra- and infra-clavicular lymph nodes), this presentation is highly suggestive of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

3. **Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)**: TNBC lacks estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and excess HER2 protein. This profile makes it more aggressive and less responsive to hormone therapy or targeted therapies that rely on these receptors.

4. **Clinical Features**: The presence of metastatic lesions in multiple organs, including the brain, liver, and lymph nodes, indicates a highly advanced stage of cancer with significant systemic spread.

Considering these points:

- **Option A (Progesterone receptor positive)**: This is unlikely because TNBC does not have PR-positive cells.
  
- **Option B (ER, PR, HER2 negative)**: While this profile might seem plausible due to the lack of ER and PR receptors, HER2 positivity is a key characteristic of TNBC. The absence of HER2 expression in TNBC makes targeted therapies like trastuzumab less effective.

- **Option C (PR, ER, HER2 positive)**: This option aligns with the clinical presentation and molecular profile of TNBC. Given that the patient lacks PR-positive cells but has a negative ER and HER2 status, this profile fits well with the characteristics of triple-negative breast cancer.

- **Option D (HER2 positive)**: As mentioned earlier, HER2 positivity is not characteristic of TNBC, making this option incorrect for this case.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and molecular characteristics of triple-negative breast cancer, the most likely molecular profile for this patient is PR, ER, HER2 negative.
