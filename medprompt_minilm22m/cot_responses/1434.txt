## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, including progressive memory problems, difficulty with daily activities (wetting his pants), and avoidance of social interactions due to these issues, we can start by ruling out some conditions that are less likely based on the information provided.

Firstly, the patient's age (45 years) and profession as an accountant do not strongly suggest a specific diagnosis. However, his symptoms have been ongoing for 6 months, which is a significant duration.

The patient's past medical history is unremarkable, but this does not rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to his current symptoms.

The vital signs are within normal limits, and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) result of 22/30 indicates some cognitive impairment. However, the MMSE score is still considered within the normal range for a 45-year-old individual.

The extraocular movements are normal, which suggests that there is no obvious neurological issue affecting eye movement.

The muscle tone and strength are also normal in all limbs, further reducing the likelihood of certain neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease or progressive supranuclear palsy.

The sensory examination is unremarkable, which does not suggest any specific neuropathological changes that would point towards a particular diagnosis.

The absent Romberg’s sign and the patient's gait disturbance (feet wide apart with small steps) are key findings. The Romberg’s test is used to assess proprioception (the sense of body position), and an absent test suggests that this function may be impaired. This finding, combined with the patient's gait disturbance, points towards a condition that affects both proprioception and motor control.

Considering these factors, Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is the most likely diagnosis. NPH is characterized by the triad of gait disturbances (such as the Romberg’s sign), dementia or cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence. The patient's symptoms align closely with this condition, making it the most appropriate choice.

The CT scan of the head would be crucial for confirming the diagnosis, but based on the information provided, NPH is a strong candidate for the correct answer.

Therefore, the final model answer is:
## Answer
Normal-pressure hydrocephalus.
