## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's presentation, including developmental delay, facial changes, and specific physical characteristics such as coarse facial features, corneal clouding bilaterally, and protruding eyes, along with the absence of gross or fine motor deficiencies, suggests a diagnosis of Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II). Given that the patient has 2 mutated copies of the IDUA gene, which codes for the enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase, we can infer that the mutation is likely to be a deletion or a deletion with a frameshift effect.

The presence of corneal clouding bilaterally and protruding eyes in MPS II patients are consistent with the clinical features of this condition. The absence of gross or fine motor deficiencies suggests that the enzyme deficiency may not be severe enough to cause significant neurological impairment.

A key piece of evidence supporting this diagnosis is the patient's IDUA gene mutation, which is a deletion (B). Deletions in the IDUA gene are known to lead to MPS II, and they result in the absence or reduction of the iduronate-2-sulfatase enzyme. This type of mutation typically leads to a frameshift effect, resulting in the production of a truncated protein that is not functional.

The other options can be eliminated based on the following reasoning:

A. Chromosomal translocation (A) would involve a change in the chromosome number or structure, which is not supported by the information provided.

C. Nonsense mutation (C) involves a point mutation in the DNA sequence that results in a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. While this type of mutation can lead to MPS II, it typically results from a single nucleotide change rather than a deletion or insertion.

D. Silent mutation (D) refers to a mutation that does not result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein. However, deletions and insertions are types of mutations that do result in changes to the protein sequence, so this option is also incorrect.

Therefore, based on the patient's clinical presentation and genetic analysis, the most likely mutation found in this disease is a deletion (B).
