Given the clinical presentation of this 10-day-old male infant, which includes abdominal distension, refusal to feed, lethargy, warmth sensation during diaper changes, and a history of moderate respiratory distress post-delivery that has resolved, the most likely diagnosis is a urinary tract infection (UTI). The presence of abdominal distension, fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea in this infant suggests an infectious process.

The best initial step in managing this patient would be to perform a physical examination and take a thorough medical history. However, given the acute presentation and the need for rapid diagnosis, imaging studies should be performed as soon as possible to confirm the suspicion of UTI.

A renal ultrasound (C) is the most appropriate initial imaging study for this patient because it can quickly assess for any abnormalities in the kidneys or urinary tract that could be causing the symptoms. It is non-invasive, does not expose the infant to radiation, and can provide valuable information about the structure and function of the urinary system.

In contrast, cystoscopy (A) would be more appropriate if there were a suspicion of bladder pathology, such as a vesicoureteral reflux or a bladder tumor. Radionuclide scan (B) is not typically used for initial diagnosis of UTI in infants due to its limited availability and the need for specific indications. Urinary catheterization (D) may be necessary if there are signs of urinary retention, but it should not delay imaging studies.

Therefore, the best initial step in managing this patient would be to perform a renal ultrasound to evaluate for any abnormalities in the kidneys or urinary tract that could be causing his symptoms.
