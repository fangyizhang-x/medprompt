Given the patient's history of a right clavicular fracture 2 years ago, treated with a shoulder sling, it is essential to consider the potential for joint instability or chronic pain related to the previous injury. The patient's current complaint of knee pain localized "somewhere under the kneecap" and exacerbated by prolonged sitting, as well as the occasional "popping" sound and sensation when rising from a seated position, raises concerns about possible ligamentous laxity or meniscal damage.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate next step in management would be to assess for joint instability and chronic pain. This can be achieved through physical examination maneuvers that evaluate the patient's range of motion, strength, and stability of the knee joint.

Option A, "Pain control and rest," may provide temporary relief but does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Option B, "Physical therapy," is a reasonable next step as it can help improve joint mobility, strength, and overall function. However, given the potential for chronic pain and instability, physical therapy alone may not be sufficient.

Option C, "Arthroscopy of the knee," carries significant risks, including infection, damage to surrounding tissues, and failure to diagnose or treat any underlying pathology. This option is generally reserved for more complex cases where other diagnostic methods have failed to provide a clear diagnosis.

Option D, "Synovial fluid analysis," may be useful in diagnosing conditions such as septic arthritis or gout, but it does not address the patient's current symptoms of knee pain and instability.

Therefore, considering the potential for joint instability and chronic pain related to the previous clavicular fracture, the most appropriate next step in management would be to assess for joint stability through physical examination maneuvers.
