## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's consider the pathophysiology and treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).

1. **Understanding RDS**: Neonatal RDS is a condition characterized by inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs due to surfactant deficiency. Surfactant is a substance that reduces surface tension within the alveoli, allowing for easier lung expansion during breathing.

2. **Treatment of RDS**: The primary treatment for RDS involves supplemental oxygen to increase the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) in the blood and reduce the severity of symptoms. This helps to improve gas exchange and reduce inflammation.

3. **Possible Consequences of Oxygen Therapy**:
   - Atelectasis: While oxygen therapy can help improve lung function, it is not a direct consequence of supplemental oxygen itself.
   - Anosmia: There is no established link between oxygen therapy in RDS patients and anosmia (loss of the sense of smell).
   - Blindness: Oxygen therapy does not directly cause blindness. However, prolonged exposure to high concentrations of oxygen can lead to retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in premature infants.
   - Cardiac anomalies: There is no established direct link between supplemental oxygen for RDS and cardiac anomalies.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the pathophysiology of neonatal RDS and the treatment approach, the most likely consequence of oxygen therapy in this patient would be atelectasis, as it can lead to lung collapse due to reduced surfactant function and increased airway resistance.

Therefore, the answer is A.
