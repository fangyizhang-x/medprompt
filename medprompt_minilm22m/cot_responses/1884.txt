Given the patient's symptoms, including cola-colored urine, abdominal pain, wheals (hives), and skin lesions, we can start to piece together a potential diagnosis.

Firstly, the presence of cola-colored urine in a 12-year-old boy is highly suggestive of hematuria, which is the presence of blood in the urine. This symptom alone warrants further investigation.

The patient's history of sore throat approx. 2 weeks ago and recent onset of abdominal pain could be related to an underlying condition that may have triggered or exacerbated his current symptoms.

The intermittent episodes of wheals (hives) on the torso, legs, and buttocks are a classic sign of allergic reactions, particularly seasonal allergies. However, in this context, they also raise the possibility of another condition.

Considering the patient's recent onset of abdominal pain, hematuria, and wheals, we should consider conditions that can cause these symptoms simultaneously. One such condition is Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), a form of vasculitis that affects small blood vessels and is characterized by the deposition of IgA immune complexes.

The laboratory findings that are most likely associated with this patient's clinical presentation are those related to immune complex deposition, particularly IgA. This can be seen in conditions such as HSP, where the deposition of IgA immune complexes leads to inflammation and tissue damage.

Option B, Elevated level of serum IgA, is the correct answer because it is a hallmark laboratory finding in Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), which aligns with this patient's symptoms. The other options are not directly related to the clinical presentation:

- Option A, 24-hour urinary protein of more than 4 g, may be seen in conditions such as nephrotic syndrome or glomerulonephritis but is not specific for HSP.
- Option C, Elevated IgM-IgG immune complex rheumatoid factor, is more commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.
- Option D, Elevated levels of serum IgG and C3 protein, may be seen in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis but is not specific for HSP.

Therefore, the most likely associated laboratory finding with this patient's clinical presentation is an elevated level of serum IgA.
