## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the scenario, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Patient's Condition**: The patient is at 35 weeks gestation and has just delivered a male infant with Apgar scores of 8 and 9. This indicates that the baby is healthy.

2. **Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) History**: The patient has a history of postpartum hemorrhage after her third pregnancy, attributed to a retained placenta. This suggests that there may be an issue with placental separation or removal during delivery.

3. **Current Situation**: After the delivery, the patient experiences a smooth mass attached to the placenta following its passage through the vagina. This indicates that the placenta is not separating properly from the uterus.

4. **Clinical Findings**: The patient's vital signs are stable (temperature 98.6°F or 37°C, blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90/min, and respirations 20/min). However, the presence of a smooth mass attached to the placenta suggests that there may be an issue with placental separation.

5. **Risk Factors**: The patient's history of postpartum hemorrhage due to retained placenta increases her risk for future complications related to placental issues during delivery.

6. **Potential Complications**:
   - A. Heart failure: There is no indication in the scenario that the patient has any underlying heart conditions or signs of cardiac distress.
   - B. Hemorrhagic shock: Given the presence of a smooth mass attached to the placenta, there's a high likelihood that this mass is causing bleeding from the placental site, leading to hemorrhage and potentially shock.
   - C. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, making hypertension an unlikely complication in this scenario.
   - D. Hyperthermia: There are no signs of fever or elevated body temperature in the patient's vital signs.

Considering these factors, the most likely complication in the absence of intervention (i.e., without any attempt to remove the mass attached to the placenta) is hemorrhagic shock due to retained placental tissue causing bleeding.

The final answer is: B
