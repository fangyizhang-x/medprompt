Given the patient's history and current presentation, the most appropriate next step in management is reassurance. Here's why:

1. **Patient's symptoms**: The patient experienced urinary retention 5 days after Foley catheterization was used to treat his condition. This timing suggests that the Foley catheter may have caused or contributed to the urinary retention.
2. **Digital rectal examination (DRE)**: The DRE revealed a nontender prostate with several rock-hard nodules, which is concerning for prostate cancer. However, it does not confirm the presence of cancer and can be influenced by various factors such as prostate size, mobility, and the presence of other conditions.
3. **Serum-specific PSA**: A PSA level of 6.0 ng/mL is elevated, indicating possible prostate cancer or another condition that could be causing urinary retention. However, it's essential to consider the patient's overall clinical picture and not jump to conclusions about a specific diagnosis without further evaluation.

The options provided can be evaluated as follows:

A. **Cystourethroscopy**: This procedure involves visually examining the bladder and urethra using a cystoscope. While it may be useful in certain cases of urinary retention, it is not typically used for initial evaluation of prostate cancer or other conditions that could cause urinary retention.

B. **Transrectal prostate biopsy**: This is a diagnostic procedure that involves inserting a needle into the rectum to collect tissue samples from the prostate gland. It can help confirm the presence of prostate cancer but is invasive and carries risks, such as bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding tissues.

C. **Reassurance**: Given the patient's symptoms and DRE findings, reassurance may be appropriate if the PSA level is not significantly elevated or if other diagnostic tests are inconclusive. However, this approach should be balanced with a thorough evaluation of the patient's overall clinical picture.

D. **Repeat PSA test**: While repeating the PSA test could provide more information about the patient's prostate health, it does not address the underlying cause of urinary retention and may not be necessary if other diagnostic tests are available.

In conclusion, given the patient's symptoms, DRE findings, and elevated PSA level, the most appropriate next step in management is reassurance. Further evaluation should focus on confirming or ruling out prostate cancer through non-invasive means before considering more invasive diagnostic procedures.
