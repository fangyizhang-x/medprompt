## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, we can analyze the possible causes of her urinary incontinence as follows:

1. **Age and Multiparity**: The patient is 72 years old and has had multiple pregnancies (multiparous), which increases the risk for certain types of urinary incontinence.

2. **Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus Type 2**: This condition can lead to various complications, including neuropathy, which may affect bladder control.

3. **Family History**: The patient's mother received a ventriculoperitoneal shunt around her age, which could indicate a possible genetic or familial component to the incontinence.

4. **Symptoms and Physical Examination Findings**:
   - Episodes of involuntary urine leakage without warning after laughing or sneezing suggest stress urinary incontinence (SUI), which is often associated with weakened pelvic floor muscles.
   - The sensation to pinprick and light touch being normal suggests that the sensory nerves are not affected, reducing the likelihood of neuropathic causes.

Considering these points:

- **Detrusor-Sphincter Dyssynergia (A)**: This condition involves a lack of coordination between the detrusor muscle (which contracts to expel urine) and the external urethral sphincter (which relaxes to allow urine flow). While it can cause urinary incontinence, it is less likely given the patient's normal sensation to pinprick and light touch.

- **Urethral Hypermobility (B)**: This condition involves the urethra being excessively mobile, which can lead to stress urinary incontinence. However, the patient's symptoms do not specifically suggest this as the primary cause.

- **Impaired Detrusor Contractility (C)**: This refers to a problem with the muscle that contracts to expel urine. While it could contribute to SUI, the patient's normal sensation to pinprick and light touch makes this less likely.

- **Loss of Sphincter Control (D)**: Given the patient's age, multiple pregnancies, and symptoms suggestive of stress urinary incontinence without sensory changes, the most likely primary underlying etiology for her urinary incontinence is a loss of sphincter control. This could be due to weakened pelvic floor muscles or other factors related to her medical history.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
