## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 6-day-old infant with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, along with a karyotype of 46,XX (a typical female karyotype), we can deduce that the infant likely has congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). CAH is a group of inherited disorders that affect the adrenal glands, leading to an overproduction or underproduction of certain hormones.

The key findings in this case are:

1. Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia: These electrolyte imbalances can be caused by excessive aldosterone production.
2. Karyotype 46,XX: This suggests that the infant is genetically female.
3. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH): Given the clinical presentation and karyotype, CAH is a strong possibility.

The most likely cause of CAH in this infant would be 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which is the most common form of CAH. This enzyme deficiency leads to an overproduction of aldosterone, causing hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.

Therefore, upon further workup, we can expect to find:

- Increased levels of aldosterone: Elevated aldosterone would explain the hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.
- Decreased cortisol: CAH typically leads to decreased cortisol production due to impaired feedback inhibition by ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone).

The other options are less likely or not directly related to the clinical presentation:

- B. Decreased aldosterone, increased 11-deoxycorticosterone: This is more consistent with mineralocorticoid excess syndrome, which would present differently.
- C. Increased sex hormones, increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone: This could be seen in congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, but it's not the most direct consequence of this condition.
- D. Increased sex hormones, decreased renin activity: While CAH can affect sex hormone levels, decreased renin activity is more typically associated with primary aldosteronism or other conditions.

Therefore, the findings that are most likely to be discovered upon further workup are increased aldosterone and decreased cortisol.
