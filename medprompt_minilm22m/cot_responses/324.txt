## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's presentation and the results of her Pap smear are as follows:
- Age: 27 years old
- Symptoms: None mentioned
- Past medical history: No past medical issues, routine gynecologic care with normal pap smears every 3 years since age 21
- Findings: Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) on the Pap smear

Given these details, the next best step in management is to further investigate the ASCUS result. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that women with an ASCUS Pap smear result should undergo a colposcopy to evaluate for any abnormal cell changes.

A colposcopy involves a detailed examination of the cervix using a special microscope, which can help identify any abnormalities or precancerous cells. This procedure is considered the gold standard for evaluating ASCUS results and identifying potential precancerous lesions.

Therefore, the next best step in management would be to perform a colposcopy, not repeat the Pap smear in 1 year (A), as this may delay necessary evaluation of abnormal cell changes. Similarly, repeating the Pap smear in 3 years (B) is also not recommended due to the potential for further abnormal findings.

Option C, performing an HPV DNA test, may be considered if there were concerns about human papillomavirus (HPV) infection or high-risk HPV types, but this would not address the ASCUS result directly. Option D, Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP), is a diagnostic procedure that can be used to remove abnormal cells from the cervix, but it is typically reserved for cases where there are visible lesions or abnormal cell changes on colposcopy.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform a colposcopy.
