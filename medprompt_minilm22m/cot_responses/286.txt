Given the symptoms presented by the 65-year-old man, including voiding urine and defecating at an inappropriate place in the community, making offensive remarks, and exhibiting an ataxic gait along with amnesia, we can deduce that his behavior is indicative of a substance-induced psychosis. The negative urine drug screen further supports this, as it suggests that he may not be under the influence of any substances.

The presence of an ataxic gait and amnesia are particularly telling signs. Ataxia refers to a lack of muscle coordination which can affect speech, eye movements, and the ability to swallow, walk and perform other physical tasks. This symptom is often associated with substance abuse, particularly those that cause sedation or impair cognitive function.

Given these symptoms, we need to consider what would lead to such behavior in an individual who appears otherwise healthy. The most likely explanation for his behavior is alcohol intoxication, which can cause a range of cognitive and motor impairments including ataxia and amnesia.

The presence of Lewy bodies (B) is more commonly associated with Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies, neither of which are directly suggested by the symptoms described. Amyloid plaques (D) are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, also not supported by this scenario. Therefore, the most likely pathological finding in this patient is drug abuse, specifically alcohol intoxication.

The final answer is: A
