## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history of chronic hepatitis B virus infection complicated by cirrhosis, it is likely that this patient has hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is a common complication of cirrhosis. The presence of a palpable mass in the right upper abdominal quadrant and the ultrasound findings of a 3-cm liver mass with poorly defined margins and coarse, irregular internal echoes are highly suggestive of HCC.

The elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in this patient's blood are also consistent with HCC. AFP is a tumor marker that is typically elevated in patients with HCC, particularly those who have undergone liver transplantation or have a history of hepatocellular carcinoma.

A key feature of HCC is the presence of daughter cysts on abdominal ultrasound, which are small, fluid-filled structures that can be seen as separate from the main tumor mass. These daughter cysts are thought to represent metastatic lesions that have formed in response to the primary tumor.

In contrast, liver biopsy is not typically required for the diagnosis of HCC, especially in patients with cirrhosis who may have underlying liver disease that makes biopsies more challenging or risky. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

Option B is also incorrect because while it is true that AFP can be elevated in HCC, it is not a feature of this patient's condition. Option C is incorrect because HCC typically arises from hepatocytes, which are the main cell type of the liver. While other types of liver cells, such as cholangiocytes or bile duct epithelium, can also be involved in HCC, hepatocytes are the most common origin.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D: Daughter cysts are usually present on abdominal ultrasound.
