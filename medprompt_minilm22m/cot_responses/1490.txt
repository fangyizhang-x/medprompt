Firstly, it's essential to understand that the symptoms described for the 3-year-old are concerning and warrant further evaluation. The mother's concerns about regression in motor development and brief episodes of uncontrollable shaking suggest a neurological or neuromuscular issue.

The muscle biopsy results showing red ragged fibers are indicative of mitochondrial myopathies, which are genetic diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. These conditions can affect various organs, including the nervous system, muscles, and heart.

Given this diagnosis, it's crucial to consider the potential impact on other family members. Mitochondrial diseases often have a pattern of inheritance, with some families being more affected than others due to variations in gene expression or copy number.

The most accurate response would be that there is a 50% chance that each son will be affected by the mitochondrial disease, as this is a common pattern seen in many mitochondrial disorders. The severity of the condition can vary significantly among individuals with the same mutation, and some may have milder symptoms than others.

Option A (100% he will be affected) is incorrect because it oversimplifies the complexity of mitochondrial diseases and does not account for the variability in expression among family members. Option B (he will be unaffected) is also incorrect as there is no evidence to suggest that this child would not have any symptoms or issues related to his condition. Option C (100% he will be affected, and the severity will be the same) is incorrect because it implies a uniform effect on all family members, which is not typically seen in mitochondrial diseases.

Therefore, the physician should provide a clear and accurate assessment of the risk to each son, taking into account the variability in expression among individuals with the same mutation.
