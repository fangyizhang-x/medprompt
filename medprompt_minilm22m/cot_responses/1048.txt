## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine the patient's strongest predisposing factor for developing high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), we need to consider each option in relation to CIN.

Firstly, let's evaluate option A: Early onset of sexual activity. While early initiation of sexual activity can increase the risk of STIs and unintended pregnancy, there is no direct link between early sexual activity and the development of CIN.

Next, let's examine option B: Obesity. Obesity has been linked to an increased risk of several cancers, including cervical cancer. However, its association with CIN is not as strong or direct as other factors.

Option C: Family history of cancer. A family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative (mother) increases the risk of developing breast cancer, but there is no established link between a family history of breast cancer and the development of CIN.

Finally, let's consider option D: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hormonal disorder that can increase the risk of several reproductive health issues, including infertility, irregular menstrual cycles, and an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer. However, its association with CIN is not as well-established or direct as other factors.

Considering these options, the strongest predisposing factor for developing high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in this patient appears to be obesity (option B). Obesity has been linked to an increased risk of several cancers, including cervical cancer, and may also contribute to chronic inflammation, which can increase the risk of CIN.

The final answer is: B
