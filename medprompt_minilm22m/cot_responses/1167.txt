## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's identify the key elements of the question:

1. The patient has metastatic breast cancer and is receiving adjuvant therapy.
2. The treatment involves a drug that inhibits deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) formation, leading to an accumulation of deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP).
3. The patient needs to avoid folic acid supplementation due to potential toxic effects.

Based on these elements, we can analyze the options:

A. Hydroxyurea is a myelosuppressive agent that works by inhibiting DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, but it does not specifically inhibit dTMP formation or accumulate dUTP.

B. Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant that works by inhibiting purine synthesis, which can lead to the accumulation of dUMP (deoxyuridine monophosphate) rather than dUTP. However, it does not directly inhibit dTMP formation.

C. Mycophenolate mofetil is a purine synthesis inhibitor that specifically blocks the conversion of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP), which leads to an accumulation of IMP and subsequently dUMP, rather than dUTP.

D. Capecitabine is a prodrug that is converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the body. 5-FU works by inhibiting thymidylate synthase, which leads to an accumulation of dTMP and subsequently dUTP. This matches all the criteria mentioned in the question.

Therefore, based on the mechanism of action and side effect profile, the most likely drug given is Capecitabine.
