## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Firstly, let's consider the symptoms presented by the patient: rapid weight loss, episodes of diarrhea, amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), underperformance at school, and physical examination findings such as inflamed skin, erythematous tongue, and bright red tongue. These symptoms are highly suggestive of a vitamin deficiency.

The most likely vitamin deficiency in this patient is niacin (vitamin B3). Here's why:

- Rapid weight loss: Niacin plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, and its deficiency can lead to weight loss.
- Episodes of diarrhea: Diarrhea can be a symptom of niacin deficiency due to its role in maintaining healthy gut bacteria.
- Amenorrhea: Niacin is involved in the synthesis of estrogen, which regulates menstrual cycles. A deficiency can lead to hormonal imbalances.
- Underperformance at school and strange behavior: These symptoms could be related to various factors, but given the context of a vitamin deficiency, it's more likely related to niacin deficiency.
- Physical examination findings: The inflamed skin and erythematous tongue are consistent with niacin deficiency.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:

A. Niacin is not derived from tyrosine; it is synthesized in the body from tryptophan, an amino acid.

B. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) and vitamin B6 are involved in different metabolic pathways, and niacin synthesis does not require them.

C. There is no established link between niacin deficiency and hypertension treatment.

D. Niacin synthesis requires vitamin B2 (riboflavin) and vitamin B6, but the patient's symptoms do not suggest a niacin or riboflavin deficiency.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely vitamin deficient in this patient is niacin.
