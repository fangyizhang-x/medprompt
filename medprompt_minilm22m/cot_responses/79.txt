To address the question, we need to consider the current guidelines and recommendations for managing heart failure in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV symptoms.

Firstly, let's review the options provided:

A. Spironolactone - This is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can be used in the treatment of heart failure, particularly in patients with NYHA class III or IV symptoms. However, its addition to the current guidelines for improving overall survival in this specific scenario may not be as effective as other options.

B. Amiloride - Similar to spironolactone, amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can be used in heart failure management but is not typically added to the current guidelines for improved overall survival.

C. Hydrochlorothiazide - This is a thiazide diuretic commonly used in the treatment of hypertension and edema associated with heart failure. However, its addition to the current guidelines for improving overall survival in patients with NYHA class IV congestive heart failure is not recommended.

D. Acetazolamide - This is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that can be used in the management of heart failure, particularly in patients with pulmonary edema or fluid overload. However, its addition to the current guidelines for improving overall survival in this specific scenario may not be as effective as other options.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate medication to add to the patient's drug regimen in order to improve his overall survival would be A. Spironolactone. This is because spironolactone has been shown to have a beneficial effect on mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure, particularly those with NYHA class IV symptoms.

The reason for this recommendation lies in the fact that spironolactone can help reduce mortality by reducing fluid overload and improving survival in these patients. Additionally, it may also have a beneficial effect on other outcomes such as hospitalization rates and quality of life.

Therefore, based on current guidelines and evidence-based practice, adding spironolactone to the patient's drug regimen would be an appropriate step to improve his overall survival.
