## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's analyze the clinical presentation and physical examination findings:
- Involuntary hand movements that improve with alcohol consumption are suggestive of essential tremor.
- Bilateral hand tremors worsened by arm extension are a characteristic feature of this condition.

Given the diagnosis of essential tremor, the physician prescribes a medication known to be effective for this condition. The medication in question is often beta-blockers or anticholinergics, but given the association with bronchospasms, we're likely thinking of a different class of medications that also have bronchodilatory effects.

The immediate effects on the cardiovascular system are crucial to consider:
- Beta-blockers are known to cause a decrease in heart rate (↓) and an increase in peripheral vascular resistance (↑), which can lead to a reduction in stroke volume (↓).
- Anticholinergics, another class of medications used for essential tremor, typically cause a decrease in both heart rate (↓) and peripheral vascular resistance (↓).

Therefore, considering the effects on the cardiovascular system:
The correct answer is B. ↓ ↑ ↑.

This option reflects the expected immediate effects of the medication on the cardiovascular system, given its association with bronchospasms and the typical pharmacological profile of beta-blockers and anticholinergics.
