## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the sudden onset of pain in the lower back radiating down the side of the leg and into the foot, especially after exercise, we can consider several potential causes. However, the presence of extreme pain with a straight leg raise is particularly suggestive of a specific condition.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option:

A. Disc herniation: This condition typically presents with more widespread back pain that may not be as localized to one side of the lower back. While it's possible, the sudden onset and specific pattern of pain in this case make disc herniation less likely.

B. Osteomyelitis: This is an infection of the bone, which can cause severe pain, especially with movement or pressure on the affected area. However, osteomyelitis typically presents with fever, swelling, and redness around the affected bone, which are not mentioned in this case.

C. Spinal stenosis: This condition involves narrowing of the spinal canal, which can put pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. It often causes pain that radiates down the leg, especially after sitting or standing for long periods. The presence of extreme pain with a straight leg raise is consistent with spinal stenosis.

D. Ankylosing spondylitis: This condition typically presents with chronic back pain, stiffness, and limited mobility, which does not match this case's acute presentation.

Considering the sudden onset of pain in response to physical activity, the specific pattern of pain radiating down the leg and into the foot, and the presence of extreme pain with a straight leg raise, spinal stenosis is the most likely diagnosis. This condition can cause significant back pain that may not be immediately apparent but becomes more noticeable after prolonged periods of sitting or standing.

The answer choices provided are:

A. Disc herniation
B. Osteomyelitis
C. Spinal stenosis
D. Ankylosing spondylitis

## Answer Explanation:
Given the information and analysis, spinal stenosis is the most likely diagnosis due to its characteristic presentation of sudden-onset pain radiating down the leg and into the foot after physical activity, as well as extreme pain with a straight leg raise.
