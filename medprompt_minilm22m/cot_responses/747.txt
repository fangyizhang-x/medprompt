## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the information provided, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Age and Presentation**: The patient is a 13-year-old boy presenting with a breast lump beneath his right nipple. This age group is more commonly affected by certain types of breast tumors.

2. **Symptoms and Examination Findings**: The lump is described as mildly tender, firm, and 2-cm in size, located subareolarly (under the areola), without any changes to the nipple or skin. These characteristics suggest a benign process rather than an invasive cancer.

3. **Allergic Rhinitis Treatment**: The patient's treatment with cetirizine for allergic rhinitis is relevant because it may have caused a hormonal imbalance, particularly an increase in testosterone levels. Testosterone can stimulate breast tissue growth and development, potentially leading to the formation of benign tumors like fibroadenomas.

4. **Sexual Development Stage**: Tanner stage 3 indicates that the patient's secondary sexual characteristics are fully developed, which could be relevant when considering the potential for hormonal influences on breast development.

5. **Options Evaluation**:
   - A. Leydig Cell Tumor: These tumors are more common in adults and typically present with virilization symptoms (e.g., acne, hirsutism) rather than a single firm lump.
   - B. Adverse Effect of Medication: Given the patient's recent initiation of cetirizine for allergic rhinitis, it is plausible that this medication could have caused an increase in testosterone levels, leading to breast tissue growth and development.
   - C. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma: This type of breast cancer typically presents with a palpable mass, skin changes, or nipple discharge, which does not match the patient's presentation.
   - D. Normal Development: While it is true that testosterone can stimulate breast tissue growth during puberty, the presence of a firm, tender lump without any other symptoms (e.g., nipple discharge) makes this option less likely.

Considering these factors, the most plausible explanation for the patient's breast lump is an adverse effect of medication, specifically the increase in testosterone levels due to allergic rhinitis treatment.

The final answer is: B
