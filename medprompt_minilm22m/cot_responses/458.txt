## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's first understand the mechanisms of action for both losartan and lisinopril.

Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB). It works by blocking the action of angiotensin II at its receptor, which leads to a decrease in vasoconstriction and a subsequent decrease in blood pressure. Additionally, losartan has some direct effects on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including an increase in the clearance of bradykinin.

Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It works by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. By blocking this conversion, lisinopril leads to a decrease in blood pressure and an increase in the levels of bradykinin.

Now, let's compare these mechanisms:

- The direct effect of losartan on renin is not significant, but it does have some indirect effects.
- Lisinopril directly decreases angiotensin II levels by inhibiting its conversion to angiotensin I.

Given this information, when comparing the two medications, we can expect that lisinopril would produce a decrease in renin (since ACE inhibitors like lisinopril inhibit the RAS), while losartan does not have a significant direct effect on renin levels. Additionally, since losartan increases bradykinin levels indirectly through its effects on the RAS and ACE pathway, we can expect that lisinopril would decrease bradykinin levels.

Therefore, the answer is:

B. Renin decrease; angiotensin 1 increase
