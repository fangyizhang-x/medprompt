## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Elevated serum beta-HCG and AFP levels**: These markers are typically associated with certain types of germ cell tumors, particularly yolk sac tumors (embryonal carcinoma) and choriocarcinoma (human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-producing tumors). However, in the context of a predominantly solid mass in the left ovary, these findings more strongly suggest an embryonal carcinoma.

2. **Abdominal ultrasound showing a predominantly solid mass in the left ovary**: This finding is highly suggestive of an embryonal carcinoma, which is known to be a malignant germ cell tumor that can present as a solid mass within the ovary.

3. **No abnormal findings on the right ovary and uterus**: This suggests that the ovarian masses are likely unilateral, which aligns with the presentation of an embryonal carcinoma.

4. **Corpus luteum cyst (A)**: While corpus luteum cysts can occur in young women, they typically present as a fluid-filled mass within the ovary and may not be solid or malignant.

5. **Krukenberg tumor (C)**: Krukenberg tumors are metastatic lesions to the ovaries from gastrointestinal cancers, such as gastric adenocarcinoma. They are less likely given the clinical presentation of an ovarian mass with elevated beta-HCG and AFP levels.

6. **Serous cystadenoma (D)**: Serous cystadenomas are benign epithelial tumors that can occur in the ovary. However, they would not typically present as a solid mass or have elevated beta-HCG and AFP levels.

Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is an embryonal carcinoma of the ovary, which is a malignant germ cell tumor that presents as a predominantly solid mass with elevated beta-HCG and AFP levels.

The final answer is: B
