(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the information provided, we can analyze the developmental milestones of the 12-month-old boy and compare them to typical developmental ranges for his age.

The child's physical examination shows no abnormalities, which suggests that there are no overt medical issues contributing to his delayed development. However, we need to consider the various aspects of development mentioned in the question:

- Gross motor skills: The child can walk with one hand held (indicating some level of gross motor coordination), throw a small ball, and pick up an object between thumb and index finger (suggesting fine motor control). These are all within the expected range for 12 months.
  
- Fine motor skills: The child can wave 'bye-bye' but not say 'mama', 'dada', or 'uh-oh'. This indicates some delay in fine motor development, as these words require more precise hand movements and articulation.

- Social skills: The child cries if left to play with a stranger alone (indicating an issue with social interaction), which is a critical aspect of social-emotional development. This suggests that the child may have difficulty with separation or interacting with others in a group setting.

- Growth: There are no specific growth-related issues mentioned, such as failure to gain weight or length at expected rates.

Considering these factors, the most likely delayed skill in this child is fine motor skills, specifically the ability to articulate words and interact socially. This delay can be attributed to difficulties with language development and social interaction, which are fundamental aspects of human communication and social behavior.

The final answer is: C
