To verify adequate fluid infusion in a patient with severe chemical burns, we need to consider the most reliable and accurate method that can provide information about the adequacy of fluid resuscitation.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option:

A. The Parkland formula is used for calculating the amount of fluids needed for resuscitation in burn patients, but it assumes a certain percentage of total body water (TBW) loss, which may not accurately reflect the patient's actual fluid needs. While it can provide an estimate, it's not the most reliable method.

B. Blood pressure is an important indicator of circulatory status, and hypotension (low blood pressure) can be a sign of inadequate fluid resuscitation. However, it may not directly indicate the adequacy of fluid infusion in terms of volume or rate.

C. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) measures the pressure in the left atrium, which reflects the pressure in the pulmonary capillaries. It's a useful indicator of right heart function and can provide information about fluid overload or congestion. However, it may not directly indicate the adequacy of fluid infusion for burn patients.

D. Urinary output is an important indicator of renal perfusion and can be used to assess the adequacy of fluid resuscitation in terms of volume status. In burn patients, adequate urinary output (typically >0.5 mL/kg/hour) is often used as a marker of sufficient fluid infusion.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate method to verify adequate fluid infusion in this patient with severe chemical burns would be to assess urinary output. This is because it provides an objective measure of renal perfusion and can help ensure that the patient's fluid needs are being met.

Therefore, the answer is D.
