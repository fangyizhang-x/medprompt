The clinical presentation and laboratory findings in this case suggest a bleeding disorder, particularly one that affects the coagulation cascade.

Firstly, the patient's age (18 months) and symptoms (swelling in the right knee after physical activity) are consistent with a bleeding disorder. The fact that there was no obvious injury to the knee also supports this diagnosis.

The family history of similar problems is an important clue, as it suggests a possible genetic component to the condition. However, the absence of other family members with similar conditions makes this less likely.

The ultrasound findings and complete blood count (CBC) results are consistent with hemarthrosis, which is bleeding into the joint space. The CBC results show a low platelet count, which can be seen in several bleeding disorders, including hemophilia A and Bernard-Soulier disease.

The coagulation test results are also crucial for diagnosis. The partial thromboplastin time (activated) is prolonged (52.0 s), indicating an issue with the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. This is consistent with a deficiency in factor VIII or IX, which are essential for the activation of factor X and subsequent clot formation.

The prothrombin time (14.0 s) is also prolonged, suggesting a problem with the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. However, this finding alone does not point to a specific disorder.

The thrombin time is normal (< 2 seconds deviation from control), which suggests that the fibrinogen level is adequate and that the clotting factors are functioning properly.

Considering these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Bernard-Soulier disease (D). This rare bleeding disorder is characterized by a deficiency in glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex on platelets, leading to impaired platelet adhesion to von Willebrand factor. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with this diagnosis.

Marfan syndrome (A) is unlikely because it typically presents with long bones, heart valve problems, and other systemic features that are not mentioned in the case.

Von Willebrand disease (B) is a common bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor. While it could explain some of the findings, the patient's age and lack of other family members with similar conditions make this less likely.

Hemophilia A (C) is also unlikely because it typically presents in childhood and is caused by a deficiency in factor VIII. The patient's
