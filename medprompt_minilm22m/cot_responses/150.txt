## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The investigator's experiment involves introducing cointroduced viruses into human epithelial cells, which leads to the production of progeny viruses with distinct phenotypes from the parent strains. This process is known as recombination.

Recombination is a process where genetic material from two different viral strains combines to form new viral genomes. In this case, the cointroduction of herpes simplex virions (one strain) and the cultured virions (from the genital herpes lesion, another strain) results in progeny viruses with phenotypes that are distinct from both parent strains.

The key features of recombination that support this explanation include:

1. The presence of progeny viruses with phenotypes that are distinct from the parent strains.
2. The fact that most genomes have material from both parent strains.
3. The involvement of cointroduction, which is a process where viral genetic material is transferred between different viral strains.

Complementation (A) refers to the process by which one virus helps another virus to replicate, but it does not involve the mixing of genetic material from two different strains. Recombination (B) involves the exchange of genetic material between viruses, but it typically results in a new virus with a unique genome that is not necessarily distinct from the parent strains. Transduction (D) refers to the transfer of viral DNA from one bacterium to another through a viral vector, which is not relevant to this experiment.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Recombination.
