To address this question, we need to consider the potential associations between various aspects of the patient's history and her risk of developing breast cancer.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option in relation to breast cancer:

A. Obesity - While obesity is a known risk factor for breast cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women, it does not directly decrease the risk of breast cancer. In fact, some studies suggest that being overweight or obese may slightly increase the risk.

B. Formula feeding - There is limited evidence to suggest a direct association between formula feeding and an increased risk of breast cancer. However, breastfeeding has been linked to a reduced risk of certain cancers, including breast cancer.

C. Endometrial cancer - As mentioned in the question, endometrial cancer was confirmed through the patient's recent endometrial biopsy. This is a critical piece of information because it indicates that the patient has already experienced cancer in her reproductive system. The presence of endometrial cancer significantly increases her risk of developing breast cancer.

D. Multiple pregnancies - Having multiple children can slightly increase the risk of breast cancer, particularly if there are any genetic factors involved. However, this is a complex topic and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between multiple pregnancies and breast cancer risk.

Given these considerations, the aspect of this patient's history that is most directly associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer is her endometrial cancer. This is because endometrial cancer has already been diagnosed in her reproductive system, which increases her risk of developing breast cancer due to shared genetic and hormonal factors.

The final answer is: C
