## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To address this patient's symptoms and concerns, we need to consider both his urinary issues (terminal dribbling, urinary urgency) and male-pattern baldness.

Firstly, let's evaluate the options provided for treating his urinary issues:

A. Alpha-1 blockade - This class of drugs is primarily used to treat hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). While it can help with urinary symptoms by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, it does not address the underlying cause of terminal dribbling and urinary urgency.

B. Squalene epoxidase inhibition - This is a mechanism related to cholesterol synthesis, which is not directly relevant to treating his urinary issues or male-pattern baldness.

C. 5-alpha reductase inhibition - This class of drugs is specifically used to treat BPH by reducing the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent form of androgen that contributes to prostate growth and enlargement. By inhibiting this enzyme, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors can help reduce symptoms such as terminal dribbling and urinary urgency.

D. 17,20-desmolase inhibition - This is another mechanism related to cholesterol synthesis, which is not relevant to treating his urinary issues or male-pattern baldness.

Given the patient's history of orthostatic hypotension and the need to address both his urinary symptoms (terminal dribbling, urinary urgency) and male-pattern baldness, the most appropriate treatment option would be 5-alpha reductase inhibition. This class of drugs is specifically designed to reduce DHT levels, which can help alleviate symptoms such as terminal dribbling and urinary urgency.

Therefore, the answer is C.
