## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history, physical examination findings, and pathologic diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma with penetration into the muscular layer, we can consider the following steps in management:

1. **Assessment of the extent of disease**: The presence of a 3-cm mass in the bladder mucosa indicates that the cancer has invaded beyond the superficial layers of the bladder wall. This suggests that radical cystectomy (option C) may not be sufficient to treat the entire tumor.

2. **Consideration of lymph node involvement**: The normal upper urinary tract and lymph nodes on imaging studies do not indicate widespread disease, but it is essential to rule out metastasis to these areas. Therefore, we should consider whether radiation therapy (option B) or palliative care might be more appropriate.

3. **Intravesical chemotherapy (IVC)**: IVC has been shown to improve survival in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), particularly those with high-risk features such as tumor size > 4 cm, depth of invasion > 50%, and positive margins. Given the patient's NMIBC diagnosis and the presence of a muscle-invasive component, IVC is an appropriate next step.

4. **Radiation therapy**: While radiation can be used in conjunction with IVC for patients who cannot undergo surgery due to comorbidities or other factors, it may not be sufficient on its own to treat the entire tumor.

5. **Palliative care**: Given the patient's age and potential comorbidities, palliative care is essential to manage symptoms and improve quality of life rather than solely focusing on curative treatment.

Considering these points, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient would be to initiate intravesical chemotherapy (option A) as a first-line treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer with high-risk features. This approach can help control the tumor locally while also addressing potential systemic disease.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$
