The clinical presentation and laboratory findings in this 12-month-old boy are suggestive of a chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), also known as chronic granuloma in infants. The key features that support this diagnosis include:

1. Recurrent episodes of gastroenteritis since birth, which may indicate an underlying immune deficiency.
2. Subcostal retractions and crackles bilaterally on cardiopulmonary examination, suggesting pulmonary involvement.
3. Enlargement of cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes, which can be seen in various infections and inflammatory conditions.
4. Bilateral consolidations on chest x-ray, indicating lung involvement.
5. Sputum culture showing colonies of Burkholderia cepacia, a common pathogen in CGD.

The laboratory finding that is most relevant to the diagnosis of CGD is the inability of neutrophils to retain superoxide (O2-) after the addition of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT). This is because NBT is used as a substrate for the electron transport chain, and its reduction by superoxide ions is necessary for the production of NBT. In CGD, the defect in the NADPH oxidase complex prevents the efficient production of superoxide, leading to impaired phagocytic function.

The defects that are commonly associated with CGD include:

* A. B cell maturation: This is not directly related to the pathophysiology of CGD.
* B. Microtubule polymerization: This is involved in the formation of the mitotic spindle and cilia, but it is not directly related to the NADPH oxidase complex or phagocytic function.
* C. Actin filament assembly: This is involved in muscle contraction and cell motility, but it is not directly related to the pathophysiology of CGD.
* D. NADPH oxidase complex: This is the correct answer, as the defect in this complex leads to impaired production of superoxide, resulting in phagocytic dysfunction.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a defect in the NADPH oxidase complex, which impairs the production of superoxide and leads to impaired phagocytic function.
