## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The initial step is to identify the causative organism based on the gram-negative bacilli identified as Cardiobacterium hominis. Given that this organism is a gram-negative bacillus, we can rule out options A and C which are both penicillin-type antibiotics.

Next, we need to consider the antibiotic resistance patterns of Cardiobacterium hominis. While there isn't specific information provided about the antibiotic resistance pattern in this case, it's essential to choose an antibiotic that is effective against gram-negative bacilli and has a good coverage for potential resistant strains.

Among the options given, ceftriaxone (B) is a third-generation cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity, including effectiveness against many gram-negative bacteria. It is also often used in combination therapy to cover for potential resistance patterns.

Switching to intravenous ceftriaxone would be the most appropriate next step in management because it provides broad coverage and is effective against a wide range of gram-negative bacilli, including Cardiobacterium hominis. This approach allows for targeted treatment while minimizing the risk of antibiotic resistance.

The other options are less suitable due to their narrower spectrum or potential for resistance:

- Switching to intravenous ampicillin (A) would be more appropriate if the organism was identified as a penicillin-sensitive gram-negative bacillus, but this is not specified.
- Switching to intravenous cefazolin (C) would be effective against some gram-positive cocci and a few gram-negative bacilli, but it may not provide adequate coverage for Cardiobacterium hominis.
- Adding intravenous rifampin (D) might be considered in certain cases of antibiotic-resistant infections, but it is not typically the first-line treatment for gram-negative bacilli.

Therefore, switching to intravenous ceftriaxone would be the most appropriate next step in management.
