## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, including dizziness (vertigo), right-sided diminished hearing, tinnitus, and ear fullness, we can deduce that these complaints are likely related to a vestibular issue, possibly due to inner ear problems. The presence of vertigo, which is characterized by a sensation of spinning or movement, along with the other symptoms, suggests an inner ear disorder.

The audiometric evaluation will provide valuable information about the patient's hearing status. In this case, we are specifically interested in the frequency range that corresponds to the inner ear structures responsible for balance and equilibrium.

Sensorineural hearing loss is a common type of hearing impairment that affects the inner ear or the nerve pathways between the inner ear and the brain. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including dizziness, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and ear fullness.

Given the patient's symptoms, low frequency sensorineural hearing loss is the most likely finding on the audiogram. This type of hearing loss typically affects individuals who are 60 years or older, which aligns with the patient's age.

High frequency sensorineural hearing loss (option B) may not be as likely in this case, as it would more commonly present with symptoms such as difficulty hearing high-pitched sounds or a hissing sound in the ears. Low frequency conductive hearing loss (option C) is also less likely, as it typically presents with symptoms related to middle ear problems, such as ringing in the ears or fullness in the ears.

Normal audiogram (option D) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and age.

Therefore, based on the patient's presentation of vertigo, right-sided diminished hearing, tinnitus, and ear fullness, along with the typical characteristics of sensorineural hearing loss, the most likely finding on the audiogram would be low frequency sensorineural hearing loss.
