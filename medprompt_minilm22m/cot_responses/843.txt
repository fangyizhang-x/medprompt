## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Firstly, let's analyze the given information:

1. The patient has a 60 pack-year smoking history, which is a significant risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other respiratory diseases.
2. A previously obtained chest x-ray was mentioned, but its findings are not provided in this question.

Given these points, we can infer that the patient likely suffers from COPD or another respiratory condition. Now, let's consider the PFT report:

1. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) measure lung function and are used to diagnose and monitor various respiratory conditions.
2. The most common abnormal findings in PFTs for COPD include:
   - Decreased forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)
   - Increased residual volume (RV), which is the amount of air left in the lungs after maximum exhalation
3. Considering the patient's smoking history, it's likely that he has COPD or another obstructive lung disease.

Now, let's analyze the options:

A. Residual volume increased, total lung capacity increased - This option is unlikely because an increase in residual volume would indicate a problem with air trapping, which is not typical for COPD.
B. Residual volume decreased, total lung capacity increased - This option is also unlikely because an increase in total lung capacity would be expected if the patient had a restrictive lung disease, such as emphysema.
C. Residual volume normal, total lung capacity normal - Given the patient's smoking history and likely diagnosis of COPD or another obstructive lung disease, this option is more plausible.
D. Residual volume normal, total lung capacity decreased - This option is unlikely because a decrease in total lung capacity would indicate a problem with gas exchange, which is not typical for COPD.

Therefore, the most likely PFT report for a 55-year-old man with a 60 pack-year smoking history and a previously obtained chest x-ray showing signs of COPD or another respiratory condition would be:

The final answer is: C
