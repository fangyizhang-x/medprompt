## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation with nausea, vomiting, metallic taste in the mouth, diffuse pruritus, blurry vision, and the specific physical exam findings (bradycardia, inability to differentiate hot versus cold, no rash), we can narrow down the potential causes.

Firstly, let's consider the seafood restaurant setting. This increases the likelihood of exposure to certain toxins that are commonly found in seafood.

A. Ciguatoxin - This toxin is primarily associated with ciguatera fish poisoning, which typically presents with nausea, vomiting, and a metallic taste in the mouth (kudzu flavor). However, it does not usually cause diffuse pruritus or blurry vision.

B. Scombrotoxin - This toxin is responsible for scombroid fish poisoning, characterized by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. It can also cause a metallic taste in the mouth (bitterness) but typically does not lead to diffuse pruritus or blurry vision.

C. Tetrodotoxin - This potent neurotoxin is found in pufferfish and other marine animals. Exposure to tetrodotoxin can cause numbness, tingling, and paralysis of the muscles, as well as respiratory failure. However, it does not typically present with a metallic taste or diffuse pruritus.

D. Type I hypersensitivity reaction - This is an allergic reaction that can be caused by various substances, including certain toxins. In the context of seafood exposure, a type I hypersensitivity reaction could potentially cause symptoms such as hives (rash), itching (pruritus), and difficulty differentiating hot versus cold temperatures.

Considering these factors, the most likely etiology of this patient's symptoms is a Type I hypersensitivity reaction to a toxin found in seafood. This would explain the combination of symptoms including metallic taste, diffuse pruritus, blurry vision, and the physical exam findings of bradycardia and inability to differentiate hot versus cold.

The final answer is: D
