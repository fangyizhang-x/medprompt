## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and presentation, the most likely cause is a urinary tract infection (UTI). The burning sensation upon urination could be indicative of a UTI, which is often caused by bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli).

The patient's worsening symptoms despite increased fluid intake and cranberry extract consumption suggest that the infection may not be responding to these measures alone. Additionally, the absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and the gravid uterus on physical examination help to narrow down the differential diagnosis.

Considering the severity of the symptoms and the fact that the patient is pregnant, a urinary tract infection should be treated promptly to prevent potential complications such as pyelonephritis or sepsis. 

Among the options provided:

A. Ampicillin - This is a broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic that can cover a range of bacteria, including E. coli. However, it may not be the most effective choice for treating UTIs in pregnant women due to concerns about resistance and potential side effects.

B. Ceftriaxone - This is a third-generation cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity against many Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli. It is often used as a first-line treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in pregnant women.

C. Doxycycline - While doxycycline can be effective against certain bacterial infections, it is not typically the first choice for treating UTIs due to concerns about its safety during pregnancy, particularly in the second and third trimesters.

D. Nitrofurantoin - This is an antibiotic that is commonly used to treat UTIs, especially in pregnant women. However, it may not be as effective as ceftriaxone in certain cases, such as those caused by E. coli or in patients with kidney disease.

Given the patient's pregnancy and symptoms, the best treatment option would likely be B. Ceftriaxone, which is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can effectively treat UTIs in pregnant women.

Therefore, the answer is B.
