## Answer
(B) Cohort study

Reasoning:

- A cohort study is a type of observational study where two groups are identified based on exposure and outcome.
- In this case, the Danish study analyzed patients who were previously treated with clarithromycin or another antibiotic to see if cardiac death resulted. This indicates that the same group of patients (those who received clarithromycin) was followed over time to observe outcomes.
- The cohort design is suitable for studying rare events like cardiac death in a specific population, as it allows researchers to identify potential causes and associations without being influenced by confounding variables.

Therefore, this study represents a cohort study.
