Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can analyze the possible diagnoses as follows:

1. **Cutaneous leishmaniasis (A)**: This condition is characterized by skin lesions that are typically painless, erythematous, and papular in nature. However, it does not typically cause numbness or tingling sensations, nor does it usually affect the eyebrows or eyelashes.

2. **Tinea corporis (B)**: Also known as ringworm of the body, this condition presents with pruritic, erythematous macules and papules that are often circular in shape. While it can cause numbness and tingling sensations, the presence of hypopigmented macules around the elbows is not typical for tinea corporis.

3. **Leprosy (C)**: Leprosy is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae that primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and eyes. The patient's symptoms, including numbness and tingling sensations in both palms, loss of eyebrows, and eyelashes, along with hypopigmented macules around the elbows, are classic for leprosy.

4. **Scrofula (D)**: Scrofula is a form of tuberculosis that affects the lymph nodes of the neck, known as cervical lymphadenitis. While it can cause skin lesions and other systemic symptoms, the specific combination of numbness, tingling sensations, and hypopigmented macules around the elbows in this patient does not align with scrofula.

Considering these factors, the most likely diagnosis for the patient's condition is **Leprosy (C)** due to the presence of numbness and tingling sensations in both palms, loss of eyebrows, and eyelashes, along with hypopigmented macules around the elbows.
