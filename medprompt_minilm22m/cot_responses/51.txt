Given the patient's symptoms, including leg pain that starts in the buttocks and extends to the thighs and calves, even during rest, this suggests a condition affecting the lower limbs. The fact that the pain persists despite rest further supports this diagnosis.

The physical examination findings of an atrophied leg with bilateral loss of hair are also indicative of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), which is often associated with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or chronic venous obstruction.

Considering the patient's history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cigarette smoking, it is plausible that he has developed atherosclerosis, which can lead to peripheral emboli formation. However, this would more likely present as acute limb ischemia rather than chronic symptoms like persistent pain in the feet during rest.

The narrowing and calcification of vessels (B) could be a contributing factor to CVI, but it is less directly linked to the patient's symptoms compared to other options.

Weakening of vessel wall (D) might contribute to DVT or other vascular issues, but again, this would more likely present as acute events rather than chronic symptoms like persistent pain in the feet.

Decreased permeability of endothelium (A) is a key factor in the pathogenesis of CVI. The condition occurs when there is an imbalance between the production and degradation of nitric oxide (NO), leading to decreased NO availability, which in turn causes vasoconstriction and increased vascular resistance. This can result in chronic venous insufficiency, as blood flow is impaired, leading to swelling, pain, and other symptoms.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and medical history, the most likely cause of this patientâ€™s condition is decreased permeability of endothelium (A).
