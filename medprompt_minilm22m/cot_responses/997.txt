## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of an indurated non-tender ulcer on the left labia majora without any signs of infection or inflammation, we can deduce that the lesion is likely a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The most common STIs that cause genital ulcers include herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human papillomavirus (HPV).

The histologic imaging characteristics of these pathogens are as follows:

- HSV typically causes painful vesicular lesions, which do not match this patient's description.
- HPV is known to cause flat, broad-based, or verrucous lesions that can be indurated. These lesions often appear on the vulva and vagina in women with multiple sexual partners.

Considering these characteristics, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. Gram-negative coccobacillus with a "school of fish" appearance - This description is more typical of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes tuberculosis.
B. Gram-negative diplococci - This is characteristic of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhea, which typically presents as a purulent discharge and can cause urethritis or cervicitis.
C. Motile and helical-shaped bacteria - This description matches the morphology of Chlamydia trachomatis, which causes chlamydia, a common STI that can present with genital ulcers in women with multiple sexual partners.
D. Vaginal epithelial cells covered with bacteria - This is characteristic of bacterial vaginosis (BV), an overgrowth of normal vaginal flora leading to a fishy odor and vaginal discharge.

Given the patient's presentation and the characteristics of the pathogens listed, the most likely cause of her condition is Chlamydia trachomatis, which matches option C.
