## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To solve this question, let's analyze each option step by step:

A. Sublimation: This defense mechanism involves redirecting unacceptable impulses or desires into more socially acceptable behaviors. In this case, the woman is using her car parking habits as a way to express frustration with her neighbor without directly confronting him. By making it difficult for her neighbor to park in his spot, she is indirectly expressing her anger and resentment towards him.

B. Regression: This defense mechanism involves reverting to earlier, more primitive behaviors or attitudes in order to cope with stress or anxiety. In this case, the woman's behavior does not seem to involve regressing to a previous state of mind; rather, it appears to be a deliberate attempt to express her emotions.

C. Acting out: This defense mechanism involves expressing unacceptable impulses or desires through aggressive or destructive behaviors. While the woman's behavior may be aggressive (e.g., making it difficult for her neighbor to park), it is not necessarily acting out in the classical sense.

D. Passive aggression: This defense mechanism involves expressing negative feelings indirectly, often through subtle or passive means. In this case, the woman's behavior does not seem to involve passive-aggressive tactics; rather, she is using a more direct and obvious method to express her frustration.

Therefore, based on the analysis of each option, it appears that the woman is demonstrating sublimation by redirecting her unacceptable impulses into a more socially acceptable behavior (making it difficult for her neighbor to park in his spot).

The final answer is: A
