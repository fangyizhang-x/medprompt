(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The physician's approach to studying cirrhosis involves isolating a specific group (patients with prior exposure to certain risk factors) and then comparing their characteristics to those without the condition (those without prior exposure). This process is characteristic of a **Case-control study**.

Here's why:

1. The physician identifies a specific group (cases, i.e., patients with cirrhosis) and compares them to another group (controls, i.e., patients without cirrhosis).
2. Both groups are selected based on their prior exposure to certain risk factors.
3. The physician then assesses the characteristics of each group, such as prior alcohol use, intravenous drug abuse, blood transfusions, etc.

In contrast:

* A **Cross-sectional study** would involve assessing a single point in time for both cases and controls, without comparing them directly.
* A **Meta-analysis** involves combining data from multiple studies to identify patterns or trends, which is not the physician's approach here.
* A **Randomized controlled trial (RCT)** would involve randomly assigning participants to either an intervention group or a control group, which is not relevant to this scenario.

Therefore, the study design utilized by the physician is a Case-control study.
