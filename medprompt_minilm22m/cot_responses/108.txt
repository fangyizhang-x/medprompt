(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a thyroid storm, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The presence of intermittent sharp chest pain, palpitations, nervousness, tachycardia (pulse of 115/min), irregularly irregular pulse, hypertension (139/86 mmHg), digital swelling, fine tremor on both hands, and retraction of the right upper eyelid are all indicative of this condition.

The key to managing a thyroid storm is to control the hyperthyroidism. Propylthiouracil (A) is an antithyroid medication that can be used to treat hyperthyroidism but does not address the acute symptoms of a thyroid storm. Warfarin (B) and Methimazole (C) are antithyroid medications, but they do not have the rapid-acting effects needed to control the symptoms of a thyroid storm.

Propranolol (D), a beta-blocker, is often used in the management of hyperthyroidism to control tachycardia and tremors. However, it does not address the acute symptoms of a thyroid storm, which requires immediate attention to prevent complications such as cardiac arrest or seizures.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to administer Propranolol (D) to control her tachycardia and tremors, while also addressing her hyperthyroidism with Propylthiouracil (A). This combination will help stabilize her condition and prevent further complications.

The correct answer is D.
