Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can deduce that she likely has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The presence of shortness of breath that worsens on exertion, chronic cough lasting for 10 years, and coarse wheezing bilaterally are all indicative of COPD. The fact that her symptoms are exacerbated by light activities like climbing stairs also supports this diagnosis.

The patient's history of cigarette smoking is a significant risk factor for COPD. Her blood pressure is also elevated at 128/84 mm Hg, which may be related to her hypertension.

Pulmonary function testing (PFTs) is essential in diagnosing and managing COPD. The key findings from PFTs are:

- **Increased FEV1: FVC**: This indicates an obstruction in the airways, as measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) divided by forced vital capacity (FVC). In COPD, this ratio is typically increased.
- **Decreased Total Lung Capacity (TLC)**: This suggests that the lungs are not fully inflated, which can be due to air trapping or hyperinflation.

Therefore, considering these findings, the most likely pulmonary function test results for this patient would be an **Increased FEV1: FVC and decreased total lung capacity**.
