(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The clinical presentation described for this 20-year-old athlete is highly suggestive of a medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury, specifically a posterolateral corner (PLC) sprain or tear.

1. **Mechanism of Injury**: The patient's history of making a cutting move during the final game of the season, where his foot was planted and rotated outward, followed by knee buckling inward, is consistent with a valgus stress on the medial aspect of the knee. This type of mechanism is commonly associated with MCL injuries.

2. **Symptoms**: The patient's immediate pain upon injury, along with the "pop" heard during the event, are classic signs of a ligamentous injury. The absence of locking, clicking, or giving way suggests that the injury may not be as severe as an ACL tear.

3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The antalgic gait and avoidance of active knee extension are consistent with MCL injuries, which often cause pain and stiffness in the knee joint. The swelling and tenderness along the joint line are also typical for MCL injuries.

4. **Comparison to Other Options**:
   - **Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL)**: ACL tears are more commonly associated with anterior knee pain, locking, or catching sensations, especially during activities that involve pivoting or cutting.
   - **Lateral Meniscus**: While meniscal injuries can cause knee pain and swelling, they typically present with a "popping" sound and may not be as directly related to the valgus stress mechanism described in this case.
   - **Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL)**: PCL tears are more commonly associated with posterior knee pain, especially during activities that involve jumping or landing from a jump.

Given these considerations, the most likely structure damaged in this patient is the medial collateral ligament.
