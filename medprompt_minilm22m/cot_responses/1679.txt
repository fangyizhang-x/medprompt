## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's review what we know about the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

* The patient has a productive cough that is worse at night.
* He reports difficulty breathing that waxes and wanes.
* Physical examination reveals mild wheezes, bibasilar crackles, and clubbing of his fingertips.

These findings are suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly emphysema. The patient's history of smoking is a significant risk factor for COPD.

Next, let's review the pulmonary function test results:

* Tidal volume: 500 mL
* Residual volume: 1700 mL
* Expiratory reserve volume: 1500 mL
* Inspiratory reserve volume: 3000 mL

The functional residual capacity (FRC) is the volume of air present in the lungs at the end of passive expiration. It is calculated by subtracting the residual volume from the total lung capacity.

Total Lung Capacity (TLC): This includes all the volumes measured, which are:
- Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV): 3000 mL
- Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV): 1500 mL
- Tidal Volume (TV): 500 mL

FRC = TLC - IRV - ERV
= Total Lung Capacity - Residual Volume
= 3000 mL - 1700 mL
= 1300 mL

However, the question asks for FRC. Since we are not given a specific value for Total Lung Capacity (TLC), we can infer that it is likely to be around 4000-5000 mL.

Therefore, considering the options provided and the typical range of FRC in patients with COPD, the most reasonable answer would be:
