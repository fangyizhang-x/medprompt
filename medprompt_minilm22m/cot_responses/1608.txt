## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The observed findings in the anterior horn of the spinal cord sample from the patient who was involved in a snowboard accident can be explained by several options, but let's analyze each option step by step:

A. Neurodegenerative changes: While neurodegenerative changes are a common feature of many neurological disorders, they typically involve progressive loss of neurons or their connections, leading to degeneration of neural tissue. The findings in this case, such as dispersion of Nissl bodies and swelling of the neuronal body, do not suggest a gradual loss of neurons but rather an acute inflammatory response.

B. Central chromatolysis: Chromatolysis refers to the dispersion of chromatin within cells, which can be seen in various pathological conditions, including some types of leukemia and lymphoma. However, this term is more commonly associated with hematological disorders than with neural tissue pathology.

C. Reactive astrogliosis: Reactive astrogliosis, also known as astrocytic reactive change or reactive gliosis, is a type of glial cell response to injury in the central nervous system (CNS). It involves the activation and proliferation of astrocytes, which can lead to changes in their morphology, including swelling and the displacement of nuclei. This process is often seen in response to various types of CNS injuries or insults, such as those caused by trauma, infection, or inflammation.

D. Neuronal aging: While neuronal aging is a concept that has been proposed to explain some aspects of neurodegenerative diseases, it does not fully account for the observed changes in this case. Neuronal aging would typically involve gradual changes over time, such as loss of function and structural changes, which are not evident in this acute pathological scenario.

Considering these options, the most likely explanation for the observed findings is reactive astrogliosis, given the presence of swelling, displacement of nuclei, and the overall context of a CNS injury. This process is consistent with an inflammatory response to damage within the spinal cord tissue.

The final answer is: C
