### Step 1: Calculate the true positive rate (Sensitivity)
The sensitivity is defined as the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the test. In this case, it's the number of patients with diabetic retinopathy who were correctly diagnosed by the screening test divided by the total number of patients with diabetic retinopathy.

True Positive Rate (Sensitivity) = (Number of true positives / Total number of positive results) * 100
= (200 / 250) * 100
= 80%

### Step 2: Calculate the false positive rate (Specificity)
The specificity is defined as the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified by the test. In this case, it's the number of patients without diabetic retinopathy who were correctly diagnosed by the screening test divided by the total number of patients without diabetic retinopathy.

False Positive Rate (Specificity) = (Number of true negatives / Total number of negative results) * 100
= (10 / 200) * 100
= 5%

### Step 3: Calculate the positive predictive value (PPV)
The PPV is defined as the proportion of patients with a positive test result who are correctly diagnosed by the test. In this case, it's the number of patients with diabetic retinopathy and a positive screening test divided by the total number of patients with diabetic retinopathy.

Positive Predictive Value (PPV) = (Number of true positives / Total number of positive results) * 100
= (200 / 250) * 100
= 80%

### Step 4: Calculate the negative predictive value (NPV)
The NPV is defined as the proportion of patients with a negative test result who are correctly diagnosed by the test. In this case, it's the number of patients without diabetic retinopathy and a negative screening test divided by the total number of patients without diabetic retinopathy.

Negative Predictive Value (NPV) = (Number of true negatives / Total number of negative results) * 100
= (10 / 200) * 100
= 5%

Therefore, the answer is:
## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)
The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the screening test are 80%, 95%, 96%, and 83% respectively.
