Given the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, the most likely diagnosis is a functioning pituitary adenoma secreting adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), leading to Cushing's syndrome. The presence of a mass in the sella turcica on MRI supports this diagnosis.

The genetic analysis showing cells overexpressing adenylyl cyclase is consistent with ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors, which are typically characterized by mutations in the ACTH gene (ACTH1) or the CYP11B2 gene. Overexpression of adenylyl cyclase leads to increased production of ACTH, stimulating the adrenal glands to produce excess cortisol.

Considering the symptoms and findings:

- The patient's weight gain and excessive sweating are consistent with hypercortisolism.
- The prominent supraorbital ridges, prognathism, macroglossia (enlarged tongue), and disproportionately broad hands and feet are classic signs of Cushing's syndrome due to excess ACTH.
- Decreased peripheral vision bilaterally on visual field testing is a common finding in patients with pituitary tumors.

Given these considerations:

The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this condition would be Octreotide, which is a somatostatin analogue that can effectively reduce the production of ACTH and subsequently decrease cortisol levels. Octreotide works by binding to somatostatin receptors on pituitary adenomas, leading to decreased secretion of growth hormone, insulin, and glucagon, as well as reduced production of ACTH.

Methimazole is an antithyroid medication used primarily in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, which does not match this patient's presentation. Leuprolide is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist that can reduce the size of pituitary adenomas but is not typically used as a first-line treatment for Cushing's syndrome due to its potential side effects and slower onset of action.

Metyrapone is an inhibitor of 11-beta hydroxylase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of cortisol from 11-deoxycortisol. While it can be used to treat Cushing's disease (a different condition characterized by excess cortisol production), it is not typically used for ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors.

Therefore, Octreotide is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient with a functioning pituitary
