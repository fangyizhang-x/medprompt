## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's symptoms, including patchy red, scaly skin on her hands and wrists, difficulty maintaining a clean household due to irrational hand washing, and the presence of an irrational fear that her hands are dirty, suggest a diagnosis of psoriasis. Psoriasis is characterized by chronic inflammation of the skin, leading to scaling, itching, and discomfort.

The patient's symptoms started after she moved into her new house with her family, which could be related to stress and changes in environment. However, the key factor here is the irrational fear that her hands are dirty, which is a classic symptom of psoriasis. This ego-dystonic thought pattern (A) is indeed characteristic of psoriasis, as it involves an abnormal relationship between one's thoughts and feelings about oneself.

The condition can be readily treatable with topical corticosteroids, light therapy, or systemic medications such as methotrexate or cyclosporine (B). While some cases of psoriasis may have a more severe course or impact daily functioning, it is not rare for the condition to affect daily life significantly. In fact, many patients with psoriasis experience significant impairment in their quality of life due to the chronic nature of the disease and its impact on physical function.

Psoriasis can also lead to early onset dementia (C), although this is a rare manifestation. However, it is not typically associated with the symptoms described by the patient, which are more related to skin inflammation than cognitive decline.

Therefore, considering the above points, the correct answer is A: Symptoms are ego-dystonic.
