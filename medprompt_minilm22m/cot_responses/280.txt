## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, we can narrow down the possible diagnoses.

Firstly, the patient's recent travel to Wisconsin could be a risk factor for certain infections or diseases that are more common in specific regions. The mention of an ant bite prior to the onset of the skin lesion is also relevant.

The presence of a tender ulcerative lesion with a central necrotic base and purplish irregular borders on the anterior right leg, along with dilated tortuous veins in both lower legs, suggests a vascular or inflammatory process. This combination of symptoms is more suggestive of an infectious or inflammatory condition rather than a malignant one.

The patient's medical history includes Crohn's disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, which can increase the risk for certain infections or conditions.

Considering these factors, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. Ecthyma gangrenosum - This is a rare skin condition characterized by ulcerative lesions with necrotic centers, often associated with infections such as tuberculosis or syphilis. However, it is not typically associated with vascular abnormalities like dilated tortuous veins.

B. Pyoderma gangrenosum - This is a type of skin ulcer that can be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which the patient has. It also presents with tender ulcers and can have vascular involvement, including dilated tortuous veins.

C. Blastomycosis - This fungal infection can cause cutaneous lesions, but it typically presents as erythematous nodules or plaques without necrotic centers or vascular abnormalities.

D. Basal cell carcinoma - While this is a common skin cancer, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a primary malignancy.

Based on the analysis of the patient's history, physical examination findings, and risk factors, pyoderma gangrenosum (B) is the most likely diagnosis. It is an inflammatory condition that can be associated with IBD, which aligns with the patient's Crohn's disease history. The vascular abnormalities seen in this condition are consistent with the patient's symptoms.

The final answer is: B
