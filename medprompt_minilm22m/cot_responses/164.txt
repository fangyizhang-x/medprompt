Given the patient's symptoms, including hot flashes, malaise, insomnia, mild mood swings, pain during intercourse, vaginal dryness, and hyperlipidemia, we need to consider medications that can help alleviate these symptoms while also addressing her underlying condition.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option in relation to the patient's symptoms:

A. Hormonal replacement therapy with estrogen alone: While estrogen can help alleviate some of the symptoms like hot flashes and vaginal dryness, it may not address the pain during intercourse or malaise effectively. Additionally, estrogen alone might not be sufficient for managing hyperlipidemia.

B. Hormonal replacement therapy with combined estrogen/progesterone: This option addresses all the patient's symptoms more comprehensively. Estrogen can help alleviate hot flashes and vaginal dryness, progesterone can help manage mood swings, and it may also have a beneficial effect on pain during intercourse due to its anti-inflammatory properties.

C. Paroxetine: This is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), which can be effective for managing mood swings but might not directly address the other symptoms like hot flashes or vaginal dryness.

D. Gabapentin: While gabapentin can help with pain management, it's primarily used to treat nerve pain and seizures, not specifically for hot flashes or vaginal dryness.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate short-term medical therapy in this patient would be hormonal replacement therapy with combined estrogen/progesterone (B), as it addresses all her symptoms comprehensively. This treatment can help alleviate hot flashes, mood swings, pain during intercourse, and vaginal dryness while also managing hyperlipidemia.

The final answer is: B
