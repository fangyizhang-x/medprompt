(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of agitation, yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), asterixis, jaundice on the skin and mucous membranes, epistaxis, and laboratory findings such as elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) with normal bilirubin levels, it is essential to consider a diagnosis that encompasses these symptoms.

Firstly, the patient's history of cocaine and ecstasy use, along with high-risk sexual behavior, increases the risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which can lead to acute hepatitis or fulminant hepatic failure. However, the normal bilirubin levels and lack of other signs of liver dysfunction make fulminant hepatic failure less likely.

The patient's presentation of jaundice, asterixis, and elevated liver enzymes is suggestive of a metabolic disorder rather than an infectious process. The presence of leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) also supports the idea that there is an underlying inflammatory or metabolic process.

Cocaine-abstinence syndrome can present with agitation, but it typically does not cause jaundice or elevated liver enzymes. Ecstasy intoxication may lead to agitation and altered mental status, but it would not explain the laboratory findings of elevated liver enzymes and normal bilirubin levels.

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (A) is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. While the patient's laboratory findings could suggest a hemolytic process, the absence of other specific findings such as schistocytes or renal failure makes this diagnosis less likely.

Therefore, considering the combination of jaundice, asterixis, elevated liver enzymes, leukocytosis, and normal bilirubin levels, the most likely diagnosis is fulminant hepatic failure. This condition can be caused by various factors, including viral infections (such as hepatitis B or C), autoimmune disorders, or drug-induced liver injury.

The patient's history of cocaine and ecstasy use increases the risk for drug-induced liver injury, which is a common cause of fulminant hepatic failure in this population. The INR of 1.5 also supports the diagnosis of an acquired coagulopathy, such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but given the context and other laboratory findings, it is less likely.

In summary,
