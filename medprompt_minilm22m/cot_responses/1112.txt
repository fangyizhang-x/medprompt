## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation and test results, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Increased nuchal translucency**: This is a marker for an increased risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) such as spina bifida and anencephaly.
2. **Decreased β-hCG concentration**: A decrease in β-hCG levels can be seen in conditions like molar pregnancy, which is not the case here since the nuchal translucency was increased, suggesting a non-molar cause.
3. **Decreased levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A)**: PAPP-A is a marker for aneuploidy and fetal development. Low levels can indicate an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities.

Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is trisomy 13, also known as Patau syndrome. This condition is associated with severe intellectual disability, physical abnormalities, and often death in utero or early childhood.

Given this diagnosis, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Optic glioma**: While optic gliomas can be associated with various genetic syndromes, they are not a direct consequence of trisomy 13.
B. **Cutis aplasia**: This is a rare skin condition characterized by thinning and loss of skin, but it is not directly related to the diagnosis of trisomy 13.
C. **Cystic hygroma**: Cystic hygromas are fluid-filled sacs that can occur in various conditions, including chromosomal abnormalities. They are a common feature of trisomy 13 and other genetic syndromes.
D. **Prominent occiput**: A prominent occiput (back of the head) is more commonly associated with Down syndrome rather than trisomy 13.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the fetus is at increased risk for cystic hygroma due to its association with chromosomal abnormalities like trisomy 13.
