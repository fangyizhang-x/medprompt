Given the patient's presentation and biopsy findings, the most appropriate next step in management for her case would be to carefully observe her without any additional treatment at this time.

Firstly, it is essential to understand that LCIS (Lobular Carcinoma In Situ) is a non-invasive condition characterized by the presence of abnormal cells within the lobules of the breast. It is considered a marker for an increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer in the future but does not itself cause cancer.

The patient's age, lack of family history, and absence of other significant risk factors make her at lower risk for breast cancer compared to younger women or those with a personal or familial history of breast cancer. The fact that she consumes moderate amounts of wine (1-2 times per week) is also not considered a significant risk factor.

Given these considerations, the American Cancer Society and other reputable health organizations recommend careful observation rather than immediate treatment for LCIS in asymptomatic women. This approach allows for monitoring of any potential changes or progression over time without the need for additional interventions like surgery or radiation therapy.

Therefore, option B (Careful observation + routine mammography) is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient at this stage.

The other options are not recommended as initial steps:

- Option A (Breast irradiation + tamoxifen) would be considered if there were evidence of invasive cancer or high-risk features on the biopsy, which is not the case here.
- Option C (Left mastectomy + axillary dissection + local irradiation) and option D (Lumpectomy + routine screening) are more aggressive approaches that may be considered for women with a higher risk of breast cancer or those who have had previous radiation therapy to the chest, which is not indicated in this scenario.

The final answer is: B
