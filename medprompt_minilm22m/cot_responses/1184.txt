Given the clinical presentation of a 4-month-old girl who has been regurgitating and vomiting after feeding for the past 3 weeks, it is essential to consider the potential causes of her symptoms. The fact that she is breastfed and formula-fed, with no history of gastrointestinal issues or other underlying medical conditions, suggests that an infectious etiology might be less likely.

The presence of regurgitation and vomiting after feeding could indicate a problem with the esophagus or the stomach, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or pyloric stenosis. However, these conditions are typically associated with more severe symptoms, such as projectile vomiting, abdominal distension, or failure to thrive.

Considering the soft and nontender abdomen on examination, there is no evidence of organomegaly, which might suggest a more serious underlying condition like appendicitis or intestinal obstruction. The fact that she has been regurgitating and vomiting for an extended period without any significant improvement in her symptoms suggests that the issue may be related to the feeding process itself.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate next best step in management would be to investigate the cause of her regurgitation and vomiting. Among the options provided:

A. Esophageal pH monitoring: This test can help diagnose GERD by measuring the acidity of the esophagus over a 24-hour period. It is a non-invasive and relatively inexpensive method that can provide valuable information about the patient's symptoms.

B. Ultrasound of the abdomen: While an ultrasound might be useful in evaluating abdominal organs, it is not directly related to investigating the cause of regurgitation and vomiting after feeding.

C. Pantoprazole therapy: This is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that can help reduce acid production in the stomach. However, it may not address the underlying issue causing her symptoms, and its use should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

D. Positioning therapy: This involves changing the patient's position to alleviate symptoms of GERD or other conditions. While positioning might provide temporary relief, it does not address the underlying cause of the regurgitation and vomiting.

Therefore, the most appropriate next best step in management is to perform esophageal pH monitoring to investigate the cause of her regurgitation and vomiting after feeding.
