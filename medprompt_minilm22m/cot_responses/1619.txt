## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, we can analyze the possible causes step by step:

1. **Progressive weakness** over 3 months, particularly in activities that require muscle strength such as climbing stairs and getting out of a chair, suggests a neuromuscular or muscular disorder.
2. The absence of systemic symptoms like weight loss, fever, dysphagia, or joint pains reduces the likelihood of an inflammatory or infectious cause.
3. The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but there are no indications of these conditions causing his current symptoms.
4. The normal cardiopulmonary examination and absence of hepatosplenomegaly make certain conditions like liver or spleen disease less likely.

Considering the above points, let's evaluate each option:

A. **Autoantibodies**: While autoantibodies can be present in various autoimmune diseases, there is no specific indication for an autoimmune cause based on the provided information.

B. **Electromyography (EMG)**: EMG is a diagnostic test that measures the electrical activity of muscles. It can help identify muscle disorders such as myopathies or neuromuscular junction diseases. However, given the patient's symptoms and normal cardiopulmonary examination, an EMG might not be the most informative test.

C. **Muscle biopsy**: Muscle biopsy is a diagnostic procedure that involves removing a small sample of muscle tissue for examination under a microscope. It can help identify conditions such as myopathies (muscle diseases), muscular dystrophies, or other disorders affecting muscle tissue. Given the patient's progressive weakness and lack of systemic symptoms, a muscle biopsy could be an effective test to rule out certain causes.

D. **Statin cessation**: Statins are cholesterol-lowering medications that may have side effects such as myopathy or rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown). However, there is no indication in the patient's history or current symptoms that statin cessation would be necessary or beneficial.

Based on this analysis, the most accurate diagnostic test for the patient's progressive weakness and muscle symptoms would likely be a **muscle biopsy**. This test can help identify specific causes of muscle disease and guide further management.
