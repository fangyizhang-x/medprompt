Given the patient's diagnosis of stage II adenocarcinoma of the left lower lung lobe without evidence of distant metastases, we can proceed with the management plan.

Firstly, let's consider the patient's symptoms and examination findings. The chronic cough is a common symptom in patients with lung cancer, and inspiratory wheezing at the left lung base could be indicative of pleural effusion or pulmonary embolism, both of which are potential complications of lung cancer.

The spirometry results show a reduced FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) of 1.6 L, indicating a possible obstructive pattern. The diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is also reduced at 66% of predicted, suggesting impaired gas exchange.

Considering the patient's age, smoking history, and symptoms, we should prioritize non-surgical management options to preserve life and quality of life.

Option A, lobectomy, is a surgical procedure that involves removing the entire lobe of the lung. While it may be an option for some patients with early-stage lung cancer, it is not typically considered the first-line treatment for stage II disease without evidence of distant metastases.

Option B, radiation therapy, may be considered as adjuvant therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence after surgery or in combination with chemotherapy.

Option C, wedge resection, involves removing a small portion of the lung (usually 1-2 cm) and is typically used for patients who are not candidates for lobectomy due to poor lung function or other comorbidities. However, it may still be considered as an option for some patients with stage II disease.

Option D, cisplatin and etoposide, is a chemotherapy regimen that has been shown to improve survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including those with stage II disease. This option would be the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms, examination findings, and current treatment options, the most appropriate next step is to administer cisplatin and etoposide as part of a chemotherapy regimen to improve survival and potentially control the progression of the disease.
