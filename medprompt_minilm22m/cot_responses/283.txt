(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and history, we can deduce that he likely has a viral infection, possibly infectious mononucleosis (mono), given his recent exposure to someone with mono 2 weeks ago and his sister's treatment for it. The presence of fever, sore throat, circumferential oral pallor, cervical lymphadenopathy, tonsillar erythema and exudate, and a rash are all consistent with mono.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration is slightly low (13.3 g/dL), which could be due to anemia associated with the illness. The elevated leukocyte count (12,000/mm^3) also supports this diagnosis.

Considering the likely viral etiology of his symptoms, we should focus on treating a common cause of mononucleosis: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Acyclovir is an antiviral medication that can help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms in patients with EBV infection. It is often used as a first-line treatment for mono.

Amoxicillin, Azithromycin, and Cephalexin are all antibiotics that would be more appropriate if we suspected a bacterial cause for his symptoms, such as streptococcal pharyngitis or another bacterial infection.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is Acyclovir therapy to treat the likely viral cause of his mono.
