## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient's presentation and diagnostic findings suggest a diagnosis of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), a genetic disorder characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of polyps in the colon and rectum. The presence of tubular, tubulovillous, and villous adenomas on microscopic examination supports this diagnosis.

The risk of developing FAP is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is required for the condition to manifest. This means that if one parent has FAP, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene and developing the condition.

Given that the patient's partner is not a carrier of the condition, we can conclude that she does not have FAP. Therefore, the likelihood of her children developing this condition is zero (0%).

The other options are incorrect because:

* A. 25% - This is an incorrect probability value and does not reflect the risk of inheritance.
* B. 75% - This is also an incorrect probability value and does not reflect the risk of inheritance.
* C. 50% - While this is a reasonable estimate, it is not supported by the information provided.

Therefore, based on the patient's family history and the presence of FAP in his parents, we can conclude that his children are unlikely to develop the condition.
