## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation with severe vertigo, multiple episodes of vomiting and difficulty walking, along with a history of vision loss and body numbness, we need to consider a condition that could explain these symptoms.

The key points from the case:

1. **Continuous vertigo not related to position**: This suggests a vestibular issue rather than a problem with balance or equilibrium.
2. **No tinnitus or hearing disturbances**: This helps rule out conditions like Meniere's disease, which typically presents with tinnitus and hearing loss.
3. **Past history of acute vision loss in one eye that resolved spontaneously**: This could be indicative of an ischemic event (e.g., a stroke) affecting the optic nerve, but given the patient's age and lack of other symptoms, this is less likely.
4. **Recent onset of left-sided body numbness**: This symptom can be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), which often presents with vision disturbances, muscle weakness, and sensory changes.

Considering these points:

- **Acyclovir (A)**: An antiviral medication that might be used to treat viral infections like herpes zoster or varicella-zoster. While it could potentially help with vertigo associated with MS, there's no indication of a viral infection.
- **High doses of glucose (B)**: This is not relevant to the patient's symptoms and would likely have more to do with managing hypoglycemia than addressing her current condition.
- **High-doses of corticosteroids (C)**: Corticosteroids are often used in MS treatment, particularly for relapses or exacerbations. They could help reduce inflammation and alleviate vertigo associated with MS.
- **Plasma exchange (D)**: This is a procedure typically used to treat severe hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or other conditions like Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome. It's not indicated in this case.

Given the patient's symptoms, including continuous vertigo and recent onset of left-sided body numbness, which could be indicative of MS, the best course of treatment would likely involve reducing inflammation to alleviate her condition.

The final answer is: C
