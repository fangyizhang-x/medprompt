## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Firstly, let's identify the patient's demographic and clinical characteristics: a 56-year-old Caucasian male with no prior medical history, central obesity, regular heart and lung sounds, elevated blood pressure (157/95 mm Hg), and an elevated heart rate (92/min). These findings suggest that the patient is at risk for cardiovascular disease.

Next, we need to consider the guidelines for treating high blood pressure in the Caucasian population. The Joint National Committee 8 (JNC 8) recommends the following first-line antihypertensive therapy options:

1. **ACE inhibitors**: These medications block the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a natural substance that constricts blood vessels and increases blood pressure. ACE inhibitors are effective in reducing blood pressure, particularly in patients with diabetes or kidney disease.
2. **ARBs (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers)**: Similar to ACE inhibitors, ARBs block the action of angiotensin II, another vasoconstrictor that increases blood pressure. They are also effective in reducing blood pressure and may be beneficial for patients with heart failure or coronary artery disease.
3. **CCBs (Calcium Channel Blockers)**: These medications relax blood vessels by blocking calcium channels, leading to a decrease in blood pressure. CCBs are often used as an alternative to ACE inhibitors or ARBs in certain patient populations.

The other options listed do not represent first-line treatment for essential hypertension:

* Beta-blockers (BB) may be considered for patients with heart failure or coronary artery disease, but they are not typically the first choice for treating high blood pressure.
* Thiazide diuretics can increase potassium levels and may be used in certain patient populations, such as those with kidney disease. However, they are not a first-line treatment option for essential hypertension.
* Loop diuretics can also increase potassium levels and may be used in specific cases, but they are not typically recommended as a first-line treatment for high blood pressure.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

## Answer
(B) ACE inhibitor, ARB, CCB, or thiazide
