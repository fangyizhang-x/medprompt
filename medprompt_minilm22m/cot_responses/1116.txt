The physician's publication is an example of a **Case Report**.

### Explanation:

- A case report typically describes a specific patient with a particular condition or disease, often including detailed medical history, physical examination findings, diagnostic tests, and treatment.
- The primary purpose of a case report is to document the details of a patient's illness in order to facilitate further research, education, or clinical decision-making.
- Case reports are usually written for an audience that includes other healthcare professionals, researchers, and patients who may be interested in learning about the condition described.

In this scenario, the physician wrote an article describing the symptoms observed by his patient after using a new sunscreen overseas. The article was published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, which suggests that it meets the criteria for a case report.
