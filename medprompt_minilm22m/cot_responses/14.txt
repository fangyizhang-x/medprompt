## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, we can analyze each option to determine the most likely underlying cause of her symptoms.

Firstly, let's consider the patient's symptoms: coughing and fatigue for 2 years, productive white phlegm in the morning, shortness of breath walking up a flight of stairs, and scattered wheezing and rhonchi throughout both lung fields. These findings suggest an obstructive lung disease process.

Option A, "Chronic decrease in pulmonary compliance," is unlikely because the patient's symptoms are more suggestive of airway obstruction rather than decreased lung volume.

Option B, "Local accumulation of kinins," might be relevant to some respiratory conditions but is not directly related to the patient's primary symptoms and physical examination findings.

Option C, "Progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow," aligns with the patient's symptoms of productive coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. This option also takes into account the patient's history as a nurse, which may have exposed her to respiratory irritants or pathogens that could contribute to an obstructive lung disease process.

Option D, "Incremental loss of functional residual capacity," is more relevant to conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but does not directly explain the patient's acute symptoms and physical examination findings.

Considering these factors, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow, which could be due to a variety of causes including chronic bronchitis or COPD. However, given the patient's history as a nurse and her exposure to respiratory irritants, we should also consider occupational lung disease.

Therefore, the answer is C.
