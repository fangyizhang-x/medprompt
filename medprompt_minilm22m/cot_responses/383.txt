Given the patient's unstable condition, including an unresponsive state with extensive burn injuries, it is crucial to prioritize stabilization and address any immediate life-threatening concerns before considering further management.

Firstly, the patient's vital signs are stable (SpO2 of 98%), but his hemoglobin and hematocrit levels indicate significant anemia likely due to blood loss from the burns. The low platelet count (180,000/mm^3) also suggests thrombocytopenia, which could be a result of the burn injuries or sepsis.

The laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), indicating possible hepatotoxicity or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). This is concerning given the patient's unstable condition and the severity of his burns.

Considering these factors, the best course of management would be to address the immediate life-threatening concerns first. The patient's unresponsive state with signs of respiratory distress (hypoxia) due to inadequate oxygenation from the burn injuries necessitates immediate intervention.

The most appropriate initial response is to secure the airway and ensure adequate ventilation. This can be achieved through mechanical ventilation, which may require intubation if the patient shows signs of respiratory failure or inability to maintain adequate oxygenation on own.

Given the severity of the burns and potential for multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), it is also crucial to address any potential sepsis or infection. The patient's laboratory results do not provide clear evidence of a specific infection, but the elevated white blood cell count with normal differential suggests an inflammatory response that may be contributing to his instability.

The administration of antibiotics would be appropriate in this scenario, considering the severity of the burns and the presence of potential infections. However, starting intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin without further diagnostic information or evidence of a specific infection is not justified at this stage.

Lastly, addressing any thyroid function abnormalities (elevated TSH and T4 levels) with levothyroxine sodium injections may be necessary to manage the patient's hypothyroidism. However, this should be done in conjunction with other thyroid function tests to ensure that the patient does not have a more severe underlying condition.

Therefore, the best course of management for this patient is to secure his airway and provide adequate ventilation, followed by initiation of antibiotics to address any potential infection, while also addressing any thyroid function abnormalities.
