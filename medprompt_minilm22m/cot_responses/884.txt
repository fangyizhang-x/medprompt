Given the patient's symptoms and family history, it is essential to consider both cardiac and non-cardiac factors that could be contributing to his palpitations.

Firstly, the patient's episodic palpitations with a feeling that his heart "skips a beat" are suggestive of atrial fibrillation (AF), which is a common arrhythmia. The fact that he has a family history of AF and myocardial infarction increases his risk for this condition. However, the absence of other symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath makes coronary artery disease less likely.

The patient's smoking history is also a significant concern, as smoking is a major risk factor for both AF and cardiovascular disease.

Considering these factors, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. Coronary angiography: This test would be more appropriate if there were symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath, which are not present in this patient. Additionally, coronary artery disease is less likely given the absence of other symptoms.

B. Metoprolol therapy: While beta-blockers can be used to manage AF and reduce symptoms, they do not address the underlying cause of palpitations. The patient's family history and smoking history make it more likely that he has a cardiac condition rather than just an arrhythmia.

C. Permanent pacemaker placement: This is typically considered for patients with severe bradycardia (heart rate < 40 beats per minute) or those who are symptomatic due to their heart rate being too slow. Given the patient's symptoms and lack of other indications, this is not the most appropriate next step.

D. Smoking cessation: Given the patient's significant smoking history, quitting would be an essential step in managing his cardiovascular risk factors. It can help reduce his risk for coronary artery disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular events.

Therefore, considering both cardiac and non-cardiac factors, the most appropriate next step in management is to encourage the patient to quit smoking. This will not only address his current smoking habit but also reduce his long-term risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.

The final answer is: D
