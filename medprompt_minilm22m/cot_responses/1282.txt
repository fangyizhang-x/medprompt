## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms of chest discomfort, weakness, palpitations, and a family history of myocardial infarction at age 72, it is essential to consider potential cardiac causes for his presentation.

Firstly, the absence of shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or lightheadedness helps to rule out respiratory or cardiovascular conditions that might cause these symptoms. The patient's afebrile status and alertness also support this differential diagnosis.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) provided is crucial in this context. While the specific findings are not described, we can infer that they likely show signs suggestive of cardiac ischemia or potential arrhythmias given the patient's symptoms and family history.

Considering the options:

A. Urine free cortisol level - This test is more relevant for diagnosing Cushing's syndrome, which is not indicated here based on the provided information.

B. Chest x-ray - While a chest x-ray can be useful in evaluating cardiac conditions such as myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism, it does not directly address the patient's current symptoms of palpitations and chest discomfort.

C. Thyroid stimulating hormone level (TSH) - This test is relevant for diagnosing thyroid disorders, which could potentially cause palpitations and other symptoms. However, there is no indication in the scenario that thyroid dysfunction is a primary concern.

D. Urine metanephrines - This test is specifically indicated for diagnosing pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, conditions that can cause palpitations, chest discomfort, and sweating (diaphoresis). Given the patient's symptoms and family history of myocardial infarction, these are plausible concerns. The presence of a palpable mass in the adrenal gland could also be considered.

Therefore, ordering urine metanephrines is the most appropriate initial test to consider in this patient's condition, as it directly addresses potential cardiac causes that might explain his symptoms and family history.

The final answer is: D
