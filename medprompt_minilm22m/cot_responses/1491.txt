(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine the most appropriate measure of association between history of major depressive disorder (MDD) and unprovoked seizures, we need to calculate the odds ratio (OR), which is a standardized measure of association that takes into account the number of patients with MDD and those without.

First, let's calculate the total number of patients:
Total = 36 + 105 = 141

Next, let's calculate the number of patients with unprovoked seizures and major depressive disorder (MDD):
Patients with MDD and unprovoked seizures: 20
Patients with MDD but no unprovoked seizures: 35 - 16 = 19
Total patients with MDD and unprovoked seizures: 20 + 19 = 39

Now, we can calculate the odds ratio (OR) using the formula:
OR = (Number of patients with MDD and unprovoked seizures / Total number of patients with MDD) * (Number of patients without MDD and unprovoked seizures / Total number of patients without MDD)
OR = (20/35) * (16/70)

To simplify, let's calculate the product:
(20/35) * (16/70) = 0.57

Now, we can convert the odds ratio to a percentage by multiplying by 100:
OR % = 0.57 * 100 = 56.5%

Therefore, the answer is B.
