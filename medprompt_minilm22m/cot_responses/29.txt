(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To solve this question, let's consider the process described and analyze each option in the context of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that can occur to proteins.

1. **Glycosylation**: This is a process where carbohydrate molecules are attached to the protein. While glycosylation is an important PTM for many proteins, it typically involves the attachment of oligosaccharides to specific sites on the protein, not directly to lysine residues.

2. **Phosphorylation**: Phosphorylation involves the addition of a phosphate group to a serine or threonine residue within the protein. This is a common PTM that can be catalyzed by kinases and phosphatases. However, phosphorylation typically occurs on specific sites (e.g., serine 20) rather than lysine residues.

3. **Carboxylation**: Carboxylation involves the addition of a carboxyl group (-COOH) to a protein. This can occur through various mechanisms, including the addition of CO2 from carbon dioxide or other molecules. However, carboxylation is not typically associated with lysine residues in eukaryotic cells.

4. **Ubiquitination**: Ubiquitination is a PTM that involves the covalent attachment of ubiquitin proteins to specific lysine residues on the target protein. This can mark the protein for degradation by the proteasome or for other cellular processes such as signal transduction and cell cycle regulation. Given the description, where a chemically-tagged protein attaches covalently to lysine residues on the polypeptide chain after it is released from the ribosome, this process fits well with ubiquitination.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the question and considering the typical PTMs associated with proteins, the most likely modification that has occurred is ubiquitination.
