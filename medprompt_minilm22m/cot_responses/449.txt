## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Progressive confusion, myalgia, nausea, agitation**: These symptoms suggest an infectious or inflammatory process.
2. **Recent exposure to raccoon den removal**: This is a significant detail as it may indicate exposure to rabies, given that raccoons are natural reservoirs of the virus.
3. **Excessive drooling and increased muscle tone/deep tendon reflexes**: These findings are indicative of central nervous system (CNS) involvement, possibly due to a viral infection or encephalitis.

Given these points, we can consider the options:

A. **RNA-dependent DNA polymerase inhibitor**: This class of antiviral drugs is used to treat HIV and hepatitis C. While they have some activity against certain viruses, there's no clear indication that this would prevent rabies.

B. **Chemically-inactivated virus**: Inactivating a virus inactivate it, but the question asks for prevention, not treatment.

C. **Live attenuated vaccine**: Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus or bacteria, which can provide immunity without causing the disease itself. Given that this patient recently handled raccoons and is experiencing symptoms consistent with rabies, a live attenuated vaccine could have prevented his condition by providing immunity to the virus.

D. **Immunoglobulin against a bacterial protein**: This would be more relevant for treating infections caused by bacteria, such as meningitis or sepsis, rather than viral encephalitis like rabies.

Considering these factors, the most likely answer is that the live attenuated vaccine was administered to prevent the patient's condition.
