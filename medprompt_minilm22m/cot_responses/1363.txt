## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's age, medical history, and physical examination findings, we can consider several potential diagnoses.

Firstly, the presence of a rough, scaly, sand paper-like plaque on her left dorsal hand is highly suggestive of Actinic Keratosis (AK). AKs are a common skin condition that occurs in people with fair skin who spend time outdoors, especially those exposed to the sun. They are caused by damage to the skin from UV radiation and can progress to squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated.

The fact that the patient denies smoking or alcohol use makes tobacco-related and alcohol-related causes of AKs less likely. Additionally, her diet consists mainly of vegetables and lean meat, which is not typically associated with an increased risk of AKs.

Psoriasis (B) is a chronic skin condition characterized by red, scaly patches on the skin. While it can occur in people with fair skin, it is more commonly seen in individuals with darker skin types. Rosacea (C) and Seborrheic Keratosis (D) are less likely given the patient's age and the specific description of the plaque.

Given these considerations, Actinic Keratosis is the most likely diagnosis.

## Answer Explanation
The presence of a rough, scaly, sand paper-like plaque on the hand is highly suggestive of AKs. The fact that the patient has fair skin and spends time outdoors increases her risk for developing AKs. While other conditions can cause similar symptoms, the combination of these factors points towards AKs as the most likely diagnosis.
 
Therefore, the answer is A.
