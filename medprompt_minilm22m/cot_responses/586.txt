## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of severe abdominal pain, profuse watery diarrhea, blood on the toilet paper (indicative of rectal bleeding), and weight loss, along with a history of IV drug abuse and recent hospitalization for sepsis, the most likely diagnosis is an infectious colitis caused by Clostridioides difficile (C. diff). The presence of blood on the toilet paper further supports this diagnosis.

The next best step in management should be to initiate broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage to cover for potential C. difficile infection and to manage any underlying conditions that may contribute to the patient's current symptoms, such as IV drug abuse or sepsis.

Metronidazole (A) is a commonly used treatment for C. difficile infections, making it a logical choice for this scenario. Vancomycin (B) and Clindamycin (C) are also effective against C. difficile, but they may not be the first-line choices due to potential side effects or resistance patterns.

Supportive therapy alone (D) is not sufficient as the initial step in management, given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the need for broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.

Therefore, Metronidazole (A) is the most appropriate next step in management.
