The pediatrician's approach to managing acute gastroenteritis in this 11-month-old boy is based on the principles of treating dehydration and preventing complications, which are crucial for maintaining the infant's overall health.

Firstly, the pediatrician explains that the most likely diagnosis is acute gastroenteritis. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as vomiting and watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration if not managed properly. The pediatrician advises against administering specific medication at this stage, emphasizing the importance of observing the infant's condition closely.

Given the absence of blood in the stool, flatulence, irritability, or poor appetite, which are common symptoms associated with more severe gastrointestinal issues, the pediatrician suggests a follow-up evaluation after 48 hours. This approach allows for monitoring the infant's recovery and any potential complications that may arise during this period.

The pediatrician also provides dietary recommendations to help manage dehydration and prevent further complications. The most appropriate recommendation is to offer an age-appropriate diet. In the context of acute gastroenteritis, a bland diet consisting of easily digestible foods such as:

- Plain crackers
- Bananas
- Applesauce
- Rice cereal
- Toast (BRAT diet)

is often recommended. These foods are gentle on the infant's stomach and can help prevent further dehydration.

The other options are not suitable for this scenario:

- Plenty of juices and carbonated sodas would be more suitable for managing diarrhea in older children or adults, as they provide essential electrolytes and fluids.
- Diluted formula milk may not be necessary unless there is a specific concern about the infant's nutritional needs during an illness.

Therefore, based on the pediatrician's approach to treating acute gastroenteritis in this 11-month-old boy, the correct dietary recommendation is:
