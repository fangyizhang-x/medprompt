(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation and risk factors, the most appropriate next step in management would be to assess for breast cancer, particularly given her family history.

Firstly, it is essential to note that the patient's age (49 years) and the fact that she has a first-degree relative diagnosed with breast cancer at 62 years old increase her risk of developing breast cancer. The American Cancer Society recommends that women with a first-degree relative who have had breast cancer or are at high risk for breast cancer start annual self-examinations starting at age 40, regardless of family history.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, but given the increased risk, it would be prudent to perform a mammogram. The American College of Radiology recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer undergo annual mammograms starting at age 45 for women with a first-degree relative who have had breast cancer or are at high risk.

In contrast, the patient's lipid profile is not significantly abnormal, and there is no indication of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, statin therapy (option D) would not be indicated at this time.

Chest radiography (option A) may be considered in certain cases, such as for screening purposes or to evaluate for symptoms suggestive of lung cancer, but it is not the best next step given the patient's presentation and risk factors.

Colonoscopy (option B) is a procedure typically used for screening colon cancer, which is not indicated at this time. The patient's family history does not suggest that she has an increased risk of colorectal cancer.

Therefore, the best next step in management would be to perform a mammogram to assess her breast health and reduce her risk of developing breast cancer.

The final answer is: C
