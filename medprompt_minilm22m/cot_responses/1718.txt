## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 4-month-old boy, we can deduce that he has a congenital condition affecting his eyes. The key points from the history and physical examination are:

1. Inward deviation of the right eye.
2. White reflex in the right eye (indicative of retinopathy of prematurity or other retinal abnormalities).
3. Red reflex in the left eye.

Considering these findings, we need to consider the possible causes for this condition. The most likely diagnosis is Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), which is a common cause of vision loss in premature infants.

The presence of a white reflex in one eye and a red reflex in the other suggests that there may be retinal detachment or ischemia affecting one eye more than the other. This could be due to various factors, including ROP, congenital glaucoma, or other conditions.

Given the options provided:

A. Screen for galactosemia: While galactosemia is a genetic disorder that can affect the eyes and brain, it is not directly related to the clinical presentation described in this case.

B. Visual training exercises: These are typically used to improve vision in children with strabismus or other eye alignment issues, but they do not address the underlying cause of ROP or retinal detachment.

C. Fundus examination: This is a crucial step in diagnosing and managing conditions like ROP. It allows for a detailed assessment of the retina and can help identify any abnormalities that may be contributing to the clinical presentation.

D. Serum rubella titers: Rubella (German measles) infection during pregnancy can cause congenital rubella syndrome, which can lead to various birth defects, including eye problems. However, the presence of retinal detachment or ROP in this case is more likely due to prematurity and other factors rather than rubella.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be a fundus examination to assess for any abnormalities that may be contributing to the clinical presentation.

The final answer is: C
