## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's analyze the given information:

- The patient is a 20-week pregnant woman with a family history of anemia that worsens after taking certain medications.
- Her brother and maternal uncle both have anemia, which suggests a genetic component to the condition.

The pedigree shows that the patient has only one parent (mother), so we can't see any information about her parents. However, we can infer some information from the family history:

* The mother's brother and maternal uncle both have anemia.
* This means that the disease is likely inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, as it affects two generations (the patient's generation and her uncle's generation).
* Since the disease worsens after taking certain medications, we can infer that the medication may be a trigger for the condition.

Now, let's consider the possible genetic mutations responsible for this condition. One possibility is Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA), which is an autosomal recessive disorder. However, since the patient and her uncle are both affected, it's more likely that they have a different mutation.

Another possibility is Beta-Thalassemia, which is also an autosomal recessive disorder. This condition can be caused by mutations in either of two genes: HBB (beta-globin) or HBA1/2 (alpha-globin).

Given the patient's family history and the fact that she has a brother who also has anemia, it's more likely that she has Beta-Thalassemia. However, we still need to determine if her son will be affected.

In autosomal recessive disorders, each parent contributes one allele (a variant of a gene) to their offspring. If the patient and her uncle are both carriers of the disease, they must have inherited two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent).

Since the patient is 20 weeks pregnant, she has not yet passed on any genes to her son. Therefore, it's possible that her son could inherit one copy of the mutated gene from his mother and no copies from his father.

However, there are a few scenarios where the patient's son might be affected:

1. If the patient is homozygous recessive (BB), she would pass on two copies of the mutated gene to her son.
2. If the patient is heterozygous (Bb), she would pass on one copy of the mutated gene and no copies
