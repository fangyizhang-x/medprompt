## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's current status, we can deduce the following:

1. The patient has been admitted to the hospital for oral candidiasis and esophagitis, which suggests a compromised immune system.
2. His CD4+ T lymphocyte count is 180 cells/μL, indicating a severe immunocompromised state.
3. An HIV antibody test is positive, confirming the diagnosis of HIV infection.

Considering the patient's current treatment regimen with dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine, which are all effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, we can infer that his viral load is likely to be suppressed.

At 3 months after initiation of treatment, several laboratory findings would be expected:

- **CD4+ T lymphocyte count**: With continued suppression of the virus, the CD4+ T lymphocyte count should continue to increase.
- **HIV RNA levels**: The patient's HIV RNA levels are likely to decrease as the viral load is suppressed by the ART regimen.
- **HIV antibody test**: Although the patient has a positive HIV antibody test, it may not be a reliable indicator of current viral replication. However, in the context of ongoing treatment and improvement in immune function, this finding might still be considered positive.

Therefore, considering these factors:

The most likely set of laboratory findings on follow-up evaluation 3 months later would be an **↑ CD4+ T lymphocyte count** (as the patient's immune system is improving), a **↓ HIV RNA levels** (due to suppressed viral replication), and a **positive HIV antibody test** (indicating ongoing infection, although not necessarily active replication).

The answer choice that best reflects these expected findings is:
