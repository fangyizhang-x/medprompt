## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of restlessness, disorientation, sweating, tremors, mumbling to himself, and pronounced clonus in the extremities bilaterally, along with a history of major depressive disorder and recent initiation of phenelzine (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor or MAOI), we can deduce that this patient is experiencing a hypertensive crisis due to the interaction between phenelzine and another medication.

Phenelzine is an MAOI, which means it inhibits the enzyme monoamine oxidase. This inhibition leads to an accumulation of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain, causing increased levels of these neurotransmitters. However, when combined with other medications that also increase serotonin or norepinephrine levels (such as certain antidepressants), this can lead to a hypertensive crisis.

The key here is to identify which medication among the options could potentially interact with phenelzine and cause this patient's condition.

A. Mirtazapine - This is an antidepressant that also increases serotonin levels, making it a potential interaction partner for phenelzine.
B. Bupropion - While bupropion can increase norepinephrine levels, its primary mechanism of action is as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), not an MAOI. Therefore, it's less likely to cause the hypertensive crisis described.
C. Sertraline - This is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and does not have significant interactions with phenelzine that would lead to a hypertensive crisis.
D. Lithium - While lithium can increase serum levels of other medications, including MAOIs like phenelzine, its primary mechanism of action is as a mood stabilizer and anticonvulsant. It's less likely to cause the specific symptoms described.

Given this analysis, the most likely interaction that led to this patient's condition is with mirtazapine (A), which increases serotonin levels in addition to phenelzine's MAOI activity.

Therefore, the answer is A.
