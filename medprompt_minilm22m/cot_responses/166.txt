Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is aortic stenosis with possible hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or another cardiac condition that could be causing his chest pain.

The presence of a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur in the right second intercostal area is highly suggestive of aortic stenosis. This type of murmur is characteristic of aortic valve disease, which can cause symptoms such as exertional dyspnea and syncope due to reduced cardiac output.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) showing left ventricular hypertrophy further supports the diagnosis of aortic stenosis or another cardiac condition that could be causing his symptoms. Left ventricular hypertrophy is often associated with hypertension, which can also contribute to aortic stenosis.

Considering these findings, the best next step for this patient would be to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the most appropriate initial imaging test for evaluating cardiac structure and function in this patient. It can provide detailed images of the heart chambers and valves, allowing for accurate assessment of left ventricular function, aortic valve area, and any other abnormalities.

In contrast, cardiac chamber catheterization (A) may be more useful if there is suspicion of coronary artery disease or another condition that requires intervention. Chest radiograph (B) may be helpful in evaluating the lungs and heart size but would not provide sufficient information to diagnose aortic stenosis or left ventricular hypertrophy. Computed tomography (CT) chest scan without contrast (C) might be useful if there were concerns about pulmonary embolism or other conditions, but it is not the best initial test for evaluating cardiac structure and function.

Therefore, Transthoracic echocardiography is the best next step for this patient to confirm the diagnosis of aortic stenosis or another cardiac condition that could be causing his symptoms.
