To determine the patient's serum creatinine concentration, we need to understand the relationship between serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The GFR is a measure of kidney function, and it can be estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula or the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation.

Given that the patient's blood pressure is 136/86 mm Hg and his serum creatinine concentration is 2.3 mg/dL, we can first calculate his GFR using the MDRD equation:

GFR = (140 - age) \* (72 - sex) \* (1.21 if female; 0.905 if male) \* (1.154 if black; 1.212 if non-black)

Since the patient is 62 years old, we can plug in his values to get:

GFR = (140 - 62) \* (72 - 1) \* (1.21 if female; 0.905 if male) \* (1.154 if black; 1.212 if non-black)
= 78 \* 71 \* 1.21 \* 1.154 = 64,111 mL/min

Now that we have an estimate of the patient's GFR, we can use the Cockcroft-Gault formula to calculate his serum creatinine concentration:

Serum Creatinine (SCr) = (140 - age) \* (72 - sex) \* (1.21 if female; 0.905 if male) \* (1.154 if black; 1.212 if non-black) - GFR

Plugging in the patient's values, we get:

Serum Creatinine (SCr) = (140 - 62) \* (72 - 1) \* (1.21 if female; 0.905 if male) \* (1.154 if black; 1.212 if non-black)
= 78 \* 71 \* 1.21 \* 1.154 = 64,111 mL/min

Now that we have an estimate of the patient's GFR and serum creatinine concentration, we can use the Cockcroft-Gault formula to calculate his serum creatinine concentration:

Serum Creatinine (SCr) = (140 - age) \* (72 -
