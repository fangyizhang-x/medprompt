(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). The presence of dizziness episodes with spinning sensations, imbalance, progressive left-sided hearing loss, and inability to follow conversations in noisy surroundings are all consistent with BPPV.

The recent upper respiratory infection treated with erythromycin may have triggered or exacerbated the condition. However, there is no clear evidence to suggest that the patient's symptoms are related to a bacterial infection.

Pure tone audiometry showing combined low- and high-frequency sensory loss of the left ear with normal hearing in mid-frequencies further supports this diagnosis.

The most appropriate initial step in management for BPPV is to perform the Epley maneuver, which is a series of gentle head movements that help to reposition small crystals in the inner ear and alleviate symptoms. This procedure can be performed by an experienced healthcare provider or a physical therapist who has received training in the Epley maneuver.

The other options are not appropriate initial steps in management:

A. Reducing caffeine intake may help alleviate symptoms of vertigo, but it is not a specific treatment for BPPV.

B. Beginning topiramate therapy may be considered if the patient does not respond to conservative management and has refractory vertigo, but it is not an initial step.

D. Starting fluoxetine (an SSRI) would not be appropriate as there is no evidence that the patient's symptoms are related to a serotonin-related disorder.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in management for this patient with BPPV is to perform the Epley maneuver.
