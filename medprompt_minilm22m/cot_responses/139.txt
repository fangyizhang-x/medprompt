## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's analyze the given information:

- The patient and his wife are both unconscious with cyanosis (a bluish discoloration of the skin) despite being oxygenated.
- Pulse oximetry shows 100% oxygen saturation in both patients.
- An arterial blood gas (ABG) is performed on the teenager, revealing:
  - pH of 7.35 (slightly acidic)
  - PaCO2 of 31.8 mm Hg (normal range, indicating normal ventilation)
  - PaO2 of 150 mm Hg (normal, as expected for oxygenated blood)
  - HCO3- of 20 mEq/L (slightly low, which could indicate metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis)
  - SaO2 of 80% (low, indicating hypoxemia despite adequate oxygenation)
  - COHb of 18% (high, indicating significant methemoglobinemia)

Given these findings, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. Anemic hypoxia: The patient and his wife are both unconscious with cyanosis despite being oxygenated, which suggests that they may not have sufficient hemoglobin to carry adequate oxygen to their tissues.

B. Diffusion-limited hypoxia: This condition occurs when there is a problem with the transfer of oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream, such as in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the patient's ABG shows normal PaO2 and HCO3- levels, making this less likely.

C. Methemoglobinemia: This condition involves an abnormal amount of methemoglobin in the blood, which can cause cyanosis even when oxygenated. The high COHb level in this case is consistent with methemoglobinemia.

D. Carbon monoxide poisoning: While carbon monoxide (CO) can cause hypoxia by binding to hemoglobin and forming carboxyhemoglobin, the patient's ABG shows normal PaO2 levels, making this less likely.

Based on the analysis, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is methemoglobinemia, which explains the high COHb level and the presence of cyanosis despite oxygenation.
