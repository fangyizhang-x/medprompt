## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's ongoing bleeding from wounds, the need for correction of coagulopathy (as evidenced by prolonged INR and APTT), and the presence of multiple injuries requiring stabilization, the next best step in management should address both the immediate need to control bleeding and correct coagulopathy.

Firstly, the patient is already receiving 0.9% saline infusion, which can help maintain blood pressure and improve perfusion of vital organs. However, this alone may not be sufficient to control the ongoing bleeding from wounds.

Secondly, the laboratory studies indicate a need for correction of coagulopathy. The prolonged INR (26 seconds) suggests an issue with the intrinsic pathway, while the prolonged APTT (63 seconds) points towards a problem in the common pathway or both pathways. Given these findings, transfusing fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is crucial to correct the coagulopathy and replenish clotting factors.

Thirdly, considering the patient's ongoing bleeding from wounds, it is essential to address this issue as well. Transfusing packed red blood cells (PRBCs) may help improve oxygen delivery to tissues, but it does not directly address the coagulopathy or the need for correction of the INR and APTT.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to transfuse fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelet concentrate in a 1:1 ratio. This combination addresses both the immediate need to correct coagulopathy and the ongoing bleeding from wounds.

The rationale behind this choice is as follows:

- FFP provides clotting factors that can help restore normal coagulation parameters.
- Platelet concentrate helps to improve platelet function, which is critical for controlling bleeding from wounds.
- The 1:1 ratio ensures that both components are transfused together, minimizing the risk of under-transfusion or over-transfusion.

In contrast, option A (transfusing packed RBCs and FFP in a 1:1 ratio) would not address the coagulopathy directly. Option B (transfusing fresh frozen plasma only) might be sufficient to correct coagulopathy but does not address the ongoing bleeding from wounds. Option D (transfusing packed RBCs and FFP in a 1:1 ratio) is similar to option A, with an additional transfusion of PRBCs.

Therefore, the answer
