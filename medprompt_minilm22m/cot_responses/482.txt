## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To solve this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the condition**: The patient has urinary retention due to non-obstructive urinary bladder atony after abdominal surgery. This means that the bladder muscle is not contracting properly, leading to a buildup of urine.

2. **Identifying the treatment**: The new selective muscarinic (M3) receptor agonist is prescribed to improve symptoms. Muscarinic receptors are part of the parasympathetic nervous system, which regulates various involuntary functions such as bladder contraction and bowel movements.

3. **Mechanism of action of M3 receptor agonists**: These drugs work by activating muscarinic receptors in the bladder. When activated, they stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system to promote bladder contractions.

4. **Relating to the options**:
   - A. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase: This is the mechanism of action for anticholinergic drugs (e.g., atropine), which block the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates muscarinic receptors.
   - B. Inhibition of guanylyl cyclase: This is the mechanism of action for drugs that increase cyclic GMP levels, such as nitric oxide donors or phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil).
   - C. Activation of phospholipase C: This is not directly related to muscarinic receptor agonism.
   - D. Increased transmembrane K+ conductance: While this can affect muscle contraction, it's not the primary mechanism for muscarinic receptor agonists.

5. **Conclusion**: Given that M3 receptor agonists improve bladder contractions by stimulating parasympathetic activity, the most likely involved mechanism is inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which leads to an increase in cyclic AMP levels and subsequent muscle contraction.

The final answer is: A
