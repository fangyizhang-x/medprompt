Given the patient's presentation, including confusion, drowsiness, headache, mild fever, fatigue, nausea, and recent worsening of symptoms, along with her HIV infection status and low CD4+ T cell count, it is essential to consider the differential diagnosis for meningitis. The physical examination findings of papilledema and negative CT scan but positive lumbar puncture (LP) are particularly suggestive of bacterial meningitis.

The CSF analysis results show elevated opening pressure, decreased glucose levels, increased protein levels, and a low cell count. These findings are consistent with bacterial meningitis, which is typically caused by Gram-positive bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Considering the patient's HIV infection status, it is crucial to rule out opportunistic infections that can cause meningitis in immunocompromised individuals. Among the options provided:

A. CSF shows a positive acid-fast bacillus stain - This finding would be more indicative of tuberculosis (TB), which typically presents with different symptoms and laboratory findings.

B. CSF shows gram-negative diplococci - This is consistent with Neisseria meningitidis, a common cause of bacterial meningitis in young adults and adolescents.

C. CSF India ink stain shows encapsulated yeast cells - This finding would be more indicative of cryptococcal meningitis, which typically presents in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV/AIDS.

D. Multiple ring-enhancing lesions are seen on a CT scan - This description is more typical of tuberculous meningitis or other fungal infections, which do not usually present with such characteristic imaging findings.

Given the patient's presentation and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is bacterial meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis. Therefore, the answer is B.
