## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's consider the context and the information provided by the mother.

- The question is about college-age individuals (17-year-old men), which implies we are looking at a population that is still in its early stages of life.
- The recent news about fatal car crashes among college students suggests that road safety could be an issue, but it does not directly imply that this is a significant concern for the specific demographic being asked about (college-age individuals).
- There's no direct information provided about suicide rates or homicide rates specifically targeting college-aged individuals. However, we can infer some general trends based on available data.
- Cancer is more common among older populations and those with pre-existing conditions, which doesn't directly relate to the immediate concerns of a college student population.

Given these considerations:

- Suicide is indeed a significant concern for young people, but it's not typically one of the leading causes of death in this age group. According to various studies, suicide rates are generally lower among younger populations.
- Homicide can be a concern in any demographic, including college students, and might be more relevant if there were specific incidents or trends that highlighted homicide as a significant risk.

Considering these points:

The most accurate statement would likely relate to cancer being the leading cause of death for young people. This is because cancer rates tend to increase with age, especially among younger populations. While suicide can occur at any age, it's less common in younger individuals compared to older ones. Homicide rates are also more relevant when considering specific incidents rather than general trends.

Therefore, the answer is C. More of them die from cancer than suicide.
