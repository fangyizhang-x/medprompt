## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 50-year-old woman, which includes esophageal varices, alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, recent onset confusion, and laboratory findings such as mild asterixis (indicative of hepatic encephalopathy), it is essential to consider diagnostic tests that can help differentiate between the causes of her symptoms.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option in the context of this patient's presentation:

A. Noncontrast CT of the head: This test would be useful for identifying any acute hemorrhages or other abnormalities within the brain, which could explain the recent onset of confusion and altered mental status. However, given the patient's history of hepatic encephalopathy and recent onset of symptoms, this might not be the most directly relevant diagnostic step.

B. Therapeutic trial of lactulose: Lactulose is a medication commonly used to treat hepatic encephalopathy by reducing ammonia levels in the blood. Given that the patient has mild asterixis (indicative of hepatic encephalopathy) and recent onset of confusion, starting a therapeutic trial of lactulose would be a logical next step.

C. Abdominal paracentesis: This test could be useful for diagnosing conditions such as ascites or hydrocephalus, which might explain the abdominal distension and mild asterixis. However, given the patient's presentation, it is less directly relevant to her current symptoms of confusion and altered mental status.

D. Serum ammonia level: While measuring serum ammonia levels can provide valuable information about hepatic encephalopathy, this test would not be as immediately diagnostic for the acute presentation of confusion and altered mental status in this patient.

Considering these factors, starting a therapeutic trial of lactulose (B) is likely to have the most immediate impact on addressing the patient's symptoms and could potentially provide valuable information about her condition. This approach aligns with the principles of managing hepatic encephalopathy, which often involves adjusting medications such as lactulose.

Therefore, the answer is B.
