## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Phase 1: Lifting a weight with the left hand
- At the start of phase 1, the participant is lifting a 2.3 kg (5 lb) weight off a table with his left hand.
- This initial movement requires the activation of both biceps and triceps muscles in the arm to generate force.
- The biceps brachii muscle is responsible for elbow flexion, which is necessary for lifting the weight.
- As the participant lifts the weight, the biceps undergoes concentric contraction (shortening) to help lift the weight.

### Phase 2: Burpees
- During burpees, the participant engages in a high-intensity exercise that involves multiple muscle groups simultaneously.
- The initial phase of burpees primarily targets the lower body muscles, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calf muscles.
- As the participant continues with the burpee sequence, they may also engage their upper body muscles, such as the triceps and chest muscles, to maintain proper form and generate additional force.

### Phase 3: Electrical stimulation of gastrocnemius
- In phase 3, the participant is electrically stimulated to contract their gastrocnemius muscle.
- The primary function of the gastrocnemius muscle is to flex the ankle joint, which is essential for maintaining balance and stability during this phase.
- When stimulated electrically, the gastrocnemius muscle will undergo tetanic contraction (fused or synchronized contractions), leading to an increase in muscle force production.

### Expected outcomes for each phase and respective muscles of interest
- **Biceps**: Initially recruited at the start of phase 1 due to the need for elbow flexion. Then, as the participant continues with burpees, they may also engage their biceps during the initial concentric contraction phase.
- **Cardiac muscle**: Not directly involved in lifting a weight or performing high-intensity exercises like burpees. However, cardiac muscle is crucial for maintaining blood flow and oxygen delivery to the muscles throughout the experiment.
- **Gastrocnemius**: Fused tetanic contraction at the end of all three experiments due to electrical stimulation, leading to an increase in muscle force production.

Therefore, the answer is:
## Answer
(D) Increase of tension in all phases
