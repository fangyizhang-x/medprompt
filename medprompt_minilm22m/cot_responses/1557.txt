## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the scenario, the most likely cause of death in this case is rabies. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Rabies exposure**: The patient was bitten by a bat during a cave diving trip, which increases his risk of contracting rabies.
2. **Delayed medical attention**: Despite feeling feverish for a week, the patient did not seek immediate medical attention, suggesting that he may have been in a state of altered mental status or had difficulty communicating his symptoms.
3. **Symptoms leading to seeking help**: The new onset of photophobia (sensitivity to light) and irritability led him to seek medical attention.
4. **Rabies post-mortem pathology**: In rabies, the hallmark histopathological feature is the presence of Negri bodies in the neurons of the brain.

Negri bodies are eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusions that contain a protein called rabies virus glycoprotein A. They are typically found in the neurons of animals infected with rabies and are a diagnostic hallmark of the disease.

Therefore, if the patient succumbs to this infection, the post-mortem pathology report would show Negri bodies in the brain tissue.

The other options are not directly related to the clinical presentation or the typical histopathological findings of rabies:

- Psammoma bodies are associated with certain types of tumors, such as papillary thyroid carcinoma.
- Pick bodies are characteristic of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
- Howell-Jolly bodies are small, round inclusions found in red blood cells due to a deficiency in the enzyme responsible for removing them from the spleen. They are not associated with rabies or any other infectious diseases.

Therefore, the answer is C. Negri bodies.
