(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and history, let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Difficulty breathing during exercise**: This symptom is suggestive of an asthma exacerbation or a respiratory condition that worsens with physical activity.
2. **Cough and end-expiratory wheezing**: These are classic symptoms of asthma, particularly bronchospasm, which occurs when the airways constrict in response to various stimuli, including exercise.
3. **Normal physical appearance**: This detail helps rule out other potential causes for her symptoms, such as a cardiac or neurological condition that might cause similar respiratory symptoms.
4. **Past episodes during rest, not during exercise**: This suggests that the patient's asthma is likely triggered by physical exertion rather than being an ongoing condition.
5. **Afebrile (no fever)**: This helps to rule out infectious causes for her symptoms.

Considering these points, the most appropriate treatment would be to address the underlying respiratory issue causing her symptoms.

- **Option A (Systemic corticosteroids)**: While systemic corticosteroids can be effective in managing severe asthma exacerbations, they are typically reserved for more severe cases or those that do not respond to other treatments. They may also have side effects and should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare provider.
- **Option B (Short acting β2-agonists)**: These medications are commonly used as bronchodilators in asthma exacerbations, especially during episodes when symptoms worsen with exercise or at night. They can help relieve bronchospasm and improve breathing.
- **Option C (Aminophylline)**: Aminophylline is a medication that can be used to treat asthma but is less commonly used today due to its side effects and the availability of more effective, safer alternatives like short acting β2-agonists. It may not be as effective in this case given the patient's symptoms.
- **Option D (No therapy, only avoidance of exercise)**: Given the patient's history of similar breathing problems during exercise but not during rest, avoiding exercise is unlikely to provide relief and could potentially worsen her condition.

Therefore, the best initial treatment for this patient would be to use short acting β2-agonists to help alleviate her symptoms.
