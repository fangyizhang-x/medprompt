## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Step 1: Assess the patient's risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD)
The patient has a history of stable angina, gout, hypertension, and a significant smoking history. These factors increase his risk for CVD.

### Step 2: Evaluate the patient's lipid profile
The patient's total cholesterol is elevated, with an LDL concentration that is also high. This suggests that he may have hyperlipidemia, which increases his risk for CVD.

### Step 3: Consider the patient's alcohol consumption
While moderate alcohol consumption (5-6 beers per week) is unlikely to significantly impact lipid profiles or increase cardiovascular risk in this context, it should be considered when assessing overall health and lifestyle factors.

### Step 4: Assess the patient's blood pressure
The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 150/85 mm Hg. Hypertension is a significant risk factor for CVD and can also contribute to the development of atherosclerosis.

### Step 5: Consider the management options for hyperlipidemia and hypertension
For patients with hyperlipidemia, statins are generally recommended as first-line therapy due to their efficacy in reducing LDL cholesterol levels. However, given the patient's smoking history, he may benefit from additional measures to reduce his cardiovascular risk.

### Step 6: Evaluate the effectiveness of lifestyle modifications for weight loss and increased physical activity
Given the patient's significant smoking history, it is likely that he has a substantial amount of excess body fat, which can contribute to his elevated lipid levels. Lifestyle modifications such as weight loss and increased physical activity are essential in managing CVD risk.

### Step 7: Consider the use of medications for blood pressure management
While lifestyle modifications are crucial, the patient's hypertension is not adequately controlled with current therapy (150/85 mm Hg). The patient may benefit from additional antihypertensive medication or lifestyle interventions to achieve better control.

### Step 8: Select the most appropriate next step in management
Given the patient's significant smoking history and elevated lipid levels, statin therapy would be an effective first-line treatment for hyperlipidemia. Additionally, addressing his hypertension through medication or lifestyle modifications is crucial to reduce his overall cardiovascular risk.

The final answer is: A
