To approach this question, let's consider the key factors that influence vitamin requirements in infants and pregnant women.

Firstly, it's essential to understand that breast milk provides optimal nutrition for infants, including a broad spectrum of vitamins and minerals. However, as the infant grows and develops, their nutritional needs change.

Vitamin A is crucial for vision, immune function, and skin health. It's also important during pregnancy and lactation due to its role in fetal development and maternal health. However, vitamin A deficiency is more commonly associated with populations that are malnourished or have limited access to nutrient-rich foods.

Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) is essential for energy metabolism and nerve function. While it's crucial for pregnant women and infants, the infant's breast milk already provides sufficient amounts of thiamine.

Vitamin D is vital for bone health and immune function. However, vitamin D deficiency is more commonly associated with populations that are exposed to limited sunlight or have limited dietary sources of this vitamin.

Vitamin C is an antioxidant that plays a critical role in iron absorption and collagen production. It's also important during pregnancy due to its role in fetal development. However, the infant's breast milk already provides sufficient amounts of vitamin C.

Considering these factors, the infant is most likely to develop a deficiency in Vitamin A (A) due to several reasons:

1. The infant arrived in Sweden with limited access to nutrient-rich foods.
2. Breast milk may not provide enough vitamin A for the infant's needs, especially considering their age and the fact that they are exclusively breastfed.

Therefore, the most likely deficiency in this infant is Vitamin A (A).
