Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can analyze each option to determine the most likely cause.

Firstly, let's consider the patient's age and menstrual status. She is a 9-year-old girl who has recently started wearing a bra and using a facial scrub for oily skin, indicating she may be entering puberty. Pubertal changes are characterized by the growth of secondary sexual characteristics, including breast development, body odor, coarse dark axillary hair, and sparse pubic hair.

Option A, "Hamartoma of the hypothalamus," is unlikely to cause these symptoms. Hamartomas are benign tumors that can occur in various parts of the body, but they are not typically associated with puberty or the specific physical changes described in this patient.

Option B, "Physiological development," is also unlikely. While physiological development does involve the growth and maturation of tissues during puberty, it does not typically cause the specific combination of symptoms described in this patient.

Option C, "Mosaic G-protein mutation," refers to a genetic disorder known as Noonan syndrome, which can cause a range of physical characteristics, including short stature, heart defects, and developmental delays. However, it is not typically associated with the specific symptoms described in this patient.

Option D, "Functioning follicular ovarian cyst," is the most likely cause of these findings. A functioning follicular ovarian cyst (FFOC) is a type of ovarian cyst that can develop during puberty, leading to the growth of secondary sexual characteristics, including breast development and body odor. FFOC is a benign condition that typically resolves on its own without treatment.

The physical examination findings, particularly the separation of areola and breast contours, nipple-areola complex formation, coarse dark axillary hair, and sparse pubic hair, are all consistent with an FFOC. The patient's height and weight percentile also support this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely cause of these findings is a functioning follicular ovarian cyst (FFOC).
