## Answer
Therefore, the answer is B.

Explanation:
To maximize the validity of the study's results and reduce bias, the researchers should have blinded the interviewers. This means that neither the patients nor the researchers knew who was being interviewed to avoid any influence from their own biases or expectations on the responses. Blinding can help ensure that the data collected are more objective and less susceptible to external factors that might affect the outcome of the study.

Blindness is particularly important in case-control studies like this one, where the researchers are trying to identify potential risk factors for a condition (in this case, depression) based on existing data. If the interviewers knew who was being interviewed, they might inadvertently influence their responses or ask questions that could lead them to suspect certain conditions or behaviors more than others.

The other options do not address the issue of bias as effectively:

A. Including more interviewers would simply increase the number of people involved in collecting data and potentially introduce new sources of bias.

C. Using Bonferroni correction on data might be a way to control for multiple comparisons, but it does not address the underlying issue of bias that can arise from the study design itself.

D. Using closed testing procedures on the data would actually increase the risk of bias by introducing more variables into the analysis and potentially leading to over- or under-representation of certain groups.
