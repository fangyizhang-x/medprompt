## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 15-year-old boy, which includes facial puffiness, smoky urine, sore throat, progressive worsening of facial edema over a week, elevated ESR (18 mm in the first hour), and specific urinalysis findings such as RBCs, WBCs, proteinuria, and presence of granular casts, we can deduce that this patient is likely suffering from post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN).

The key laboratory findings supporting PSGN include:

1. **Elevated ESR**: This indicates inflammation in the body.
2. **Dark brown urine with RBCs and WBCs**: These are indicative of kidney damage, specifically glomerular injury.
3. **Granular casts in the urinalysis**: These are specific findings for PSGN.

Considering these points:

- Option A (Normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate) is incorrect because an elevated ESR is a hallmark of PSGN.
- Option B (Positive streptozyme test) is also incorrect as PSGN does not typically result from a streptococcal infection, which would be indicated by a positive streptozyme test.
- Option C (Increased C3 level) might seem plausible because some cases of PSGN can involve an immune complex-mediated process. However, the clinical context and specific urinalysis findings do not strongly support this as the primary mechanism.
- Option D (Negative antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer) is correct because PSGN is typically caused by a post-streptococcal infection, which would be indicated by a positive ASO titer. A negative ASO titer suggests that this patient's current streptococcal infection is not related to a previous streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infection.

Therefore, the expected laboratory finding in this patient with PSGN is a negative antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer.
