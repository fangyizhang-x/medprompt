(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and preferences, we need to consider non-drowsy pharmacological options that can help improve sleep quality without causing daytime drowsiness.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option:

A. Temazepam: This is a benzodiazepine that can be effective for short-term use but is known for its sedative effects during the day. It would not meet the patient's preference for non-drowsy therapy.

B. Diphenhydramine: While diphenhydramine has some sedating properties, it is a first-generation antihistamine that can cause significant daytime drowsiness due to its anticholinergic effects. This option does not align with the patient's desire for non-drowsy therapy.

C. Suvorexant: This is an orexin receptor antagonist (ORMA) that works by blocking the action of orexins, which are involved in regulating sleep-wake cycles. It is designed to be taken at night and has a unique profile that allows it to promote deep sleep without causing significant daytime drowsiness.

D. Zaleplon: This is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agent that can induce sleep quickly but also carries a risk of dependence and withdrawal symptoms when stopped abruptly. It does not meet the patient's preference for non-drowsy therapy.

Considering these factors, suvorexant (C) emerges as the most appropriate pharmacotherapy option for this patient due to its unique profile that allows it to promote deep sleep without causing significant daytime drowsiness.

Therefore, the answer is C.
