Given the patient's history of acute pancreatitis, daily alcohol consumption (2 pints of vodka), and recent episodes of vomiting with blood-streaked vomit, it is essential to consider the potential causes of his current presentation. The key findings include:

1. **Epigastric pain and vomiting**: These symptoms are consistent with an upper gastrointestinal issue.
2. **Dry mucous membranes and tremor**: These signs suggest hypovolemia or shock, which could be due to blood loss.
3. **Hemoglobin concentration of 11.3 g/dL and hematocrit concentration of 40%**: This indicates significant blood loss.

Considering the patient's history of acute pancreatitis and recent episodes of vomiting with blood-streaked vomit, a **transmural tear of the lower esophagus (A)** is highly likely. The transmural tear would allow for blood to escape into the mediastinum or peritoneal cavity, leading to hypovolemic shock and significant hemodynamic instability.

The other options are less likely:

* **Inflammation of the esophageal wall (B)**: While possible, this would more likely present with dysphagia, chest pain, and possibly a history of chronic symptoms rather than acute onset.
* **Mucosal tear at the gastroesophageal junction (C)**: This would typically cause dysphagia to solids rather than blood-streaked vomit.
* **Neoplastic growth at the gastroesophageal junction (D)**: While possible, this is less likely given the patient's history of acute pancreatitis and recent episodes of vomiting.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's findings is a transmural tear of the lower esophagus.
