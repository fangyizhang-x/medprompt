## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the scenario, let's break down the key points:

1. **Age and Presentation**: The patient is a 5-year-old boy who has been unable to move his right elbow since the fall. This suggests a traumatic injury that may have caused significant damage.

2. **Symptoms and Signs**: The presence of ecchymosis (bruising), swelling, tenderness, and limited range of motion due to pain are indicative of a serious injury.

3. **X-ray Findings**: Although not described in detail, the fact that an x-ray was taken suggests that there is some indication of bone or joint damage.

4. **Possible Injuries**: Given the age of the patient and the mechanism of injury (falling on the monkey bars), the most likely injuries are fractures or dislocations of the elbow.

5. **Complications Considered**:
   - A. Polymicrobial infection: While possible, especially in a child with an open fracture, it is not the most direct complication related to the described mechanism and symptoms.
   - B. Absent radial pulse: This could be a sign of vascular compromise but would typically present earlier than 45 minutes post-injury.
   - C. Avascular necrosis of the humeral head: This is a known complication of elbow fractures, especially in children, where the blood supply to the humeral head can be compromised due to the fracture itself or the dislocation.
   - D. Adhesive capsulitis (Frozen Shoulder): While possible, it would not typically present immediately after trauma and might not be directly related to the mechanism described.

Considering these points, the most likely complication of this patient's injury is avascular necrosis of the humeral head due to the nature of the fracture and dislocation, which can compromise blood supply to the humeral head. This condition often occurs in children with fractures or dislocations of the elbow, especially those that are non-displaced or minimally displaced.

The final answer is: C
