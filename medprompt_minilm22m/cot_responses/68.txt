## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Step 1: Assessing the clinical presentation and history
The infant is a 5-week-old girl born at 36 weeks' gestation, with a history of breastfeeding for 15 minutes every 2 hours but now feeding for 40 minutes every 4 hours. This change in feeding schedule could indicate an issue with her heart rate or rhythm.

### Step 2: Evaluating the physical examination findings
The infant has six wet diapers and two stools daily, which suggests a normal gastrointestinal function. However, she currently weighs 3500 g (7.7 lb) and is 52 cm (20.4 in) in length, indicating growth restriction. The grade 4/6 continuous murmur heard best at the left infraclavicular area is a significant finding that requires further investigation.

### Step 3: Considering the possible causes of the cardiac murmur
The presence of a continuous murmur could be due to various conditions, including patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), ventricular septal defect (VSD), or other congenital heart defects. However, given the infant's age and weight, PDA is less likely.

### Step 4: Evaluating the options for management
A) Prostaglandin E1 infusion - This is typically used to keep the ductus arteriosus open in neonates with PDA.
B) Indomethacin infusion - This is a medication that can close the ductus arteriosus, but it's usually reserved for infants with PDA who are not responding to other treatments.
C) Surgical ligation - This involves tying off the ductus arteriosus, which may be necessary in some cases of PDA or other congenital heart defects. However, it's a more invasive procedure and typically considered after other management options have been tried.
D) Percutaneous surgery - This is a minimally invasive procedure that can be used to close the ductus arteriosus.

### Step 5: Selecting the most appropriate next step
Given the infant's age and weight, PDA is less likely. The continuous murmur could be due to another condition, such as VSD or other congenital heart defects. Percutaneous surgery (D) may be considered if other management options have failed, but it's not the first line of treatment.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
