## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Initial Assessment:
The newborn presents with lethargy, scleral icterus (indicative of jaundice), and a high leukocyte count, which suggests an infection or inflammatory process.

### Key Findings:

1. **Worsening condition in the newborn**: The mother's lack of prenatal care increases the risk for congenital infections.
2. **Jaundice and elevated leukocyte count**: These findings are indicative of a systemic infection or inflammation.
3. **Organism isolated from blood**: This narrows down the potential pathogens to those that can be cultured from blood.

### Pathogen Characteristics:

- **Staphylococcus aureus** is known for its ability to cause severe infections, including bacteremia and sepsis, especially in newborns due to their immature immune systems.
- **Pseudomonas aeruginosa** typically causes opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals or those with cystic fibrosis. It's less likely given the context of a newborn without prior exposure.
- **Listeria monocytogenes** is more commonly associated with foodborne illness and neonatal meningitis, not typically causing bacteremia.
- **Streptococcus pyogenes** (Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus) can cause infections like pharyngitis and skin infections but is less likely to be the causative agent in a newborn with severe systemic infection.

### Laboratory Findings:
The organism grows on sheep agar, which indicates it's a Gram-positive bacterium. The ability to cause clear hemolysis when grown together with Staphylococcus aureus further supports this identification.

Given these points, **Streptococcus pyogenes** is the most likely causal organism due to its association with severe infections in newborns and its growth characteristics on sheep agar that complement the observed hemolytic effect of Staphylococcus aureus.
