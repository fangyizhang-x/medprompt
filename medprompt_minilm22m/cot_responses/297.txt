## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history of AIDS, Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), and current symptoms such as decreasing vision, seeing black spots in one eye, and dot-blot hemorrhages on fundoscopic examination, we can consider several potential diagnoses. However, the presence of multiple violaceous plaques over his trunk and extremities is particularly noteworthy.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option:

A. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis: This condition is a common complication in immunocompromised patients, including those with AIDS. CMV retinitis typically presents with vitiligo-like lesions on the retina and can cause significant vision loss if left untreated. The presence of violaceous plaques could be indicative of CMV infection.

B. Toxoplasma retinitis: This is another opportunistic infection that can affect individuals with AIDS, particularly those who are immunocompromised. However, it typically presents with more focal lesions on the retina and may not cause widespread vitiligo-like changes.

C. HIV retinopathy: While HIV-related retinopathy can cause various changes in the retina, including microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates, it is less likely to present with violaceous plaques or dot-blot hemorrhages.

D. Varicella zoster retinitis: This condition typically affects individuals who have had chickenpox (varicella) in the past, often as a result of reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. It can cause vitiligo-like lesions on the retina and may present with dot-blot hemorrhages, but it is less likely to be associated with violaceous plaques.

Considering these factors, the presence of multiple violaceous plaques over his trunk and extremities, combined with the patient's history of AIDS, Kaposi's sarcoma, and current symptoms, makes option A (Cytomegalovirus retinitis) the most likely diagnosis. This is because CMV retinitis can cause widespread vitiligo-like lesions on the retina, including violaceous plaques, which are consistent with the patient's presentation.

Therefore, the answer is A.
