## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and symptoms:

1. **Diarrhea with floating stools**: This symptom is often associated with pancreatic insufficiency or enzyme deficiencies that affect fat digestion.
2. **Change in stool character since diarrhea began**: The change in stool consistency (from loose to floaty) suggests malabsorption of fats, which can be due to a deficiency in an enzyme involved in fat digestion.
3. **Past medical history of acute pancreatitis secondary to excessive alcohol consumption**: This is crucial because it indicates that the patient has had previous episodes of pancreatic damage, which could have led to a deficiency in certain enzymes.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

A. **Amylase**: Amylase is an enzyme involved in carbohydrate digestion, primarily found in salivary and pancreatic secretions. A deficiency would more likely cause symptoms related to malabsorption of carbohydrates (e.g., diarrhea, bloating) rather than fats.

B. **Chymotrypsin**: Chymotrypsin is a protease that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides. While it plays a role in protein digestion, its deficiency is not directly linked to fat malabsorption or the specific symptoms described.

C. **Colipase**: Colipase is an enzyme that helps in the breakdown of fats (lipids) by binding to bile salts and facilitating their absorption in the intestine. A deficiency in colipase would lead to impaired fat digestion, resulting in diarrhea with floating stools due to malabsorption of fats.

D. **Lipase**: Lipase is another enzyme involved in fat digestion, but its deficiency primarily affects the breakdown of triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol. While it could contribute to some symptoms related to fat malabsorption, it's less directly linked to the specific combination of symptoms described (floating stools, foul-smelling diarrhea) compared to colipase.

Considering these points, the most likely enzyme deficient in this patient is **colipase**, as it plays a crucial role in fat digestion and would lead to the observed symptoms of floating stools and foul-smelling diarrhea due to impaired absorption of fats.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
