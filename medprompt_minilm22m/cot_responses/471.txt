## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, including headache, increased sweating, palpitations, nausea, fever (39Â°C), tachycardia (120/min), hypertension (150/90 mm Hg), tremors, impaired gait, and deep tendon reflexes 3+ bilaterally, we can deduce that her symptoms are likely related to a medication side effect.

Firstly, the patient's recent history of starting venlafaxine for treatment-resistant depression is crucial. Venlafaxine is an SNRI (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor), and it can cause various side effects, including serotonin syndrome, which presents with symptoms such as increased sweating, tremors, agitation, and autonomic dysfunction.

The patient's current symptoms of headache, palpitations, nausea, fever, tachycardia, hypertension, tremors, impaired gait, and deep tendon reflexes 3+ bilaterally are all consistent with serotonin syndrome. The fact that she was started on citalopram (an SSRI) three days ago but stopped due to lack of improvement in her symptoms further supports this diagnosis.

The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is therefore increased CNS serotonergic activity, which can be caused by an SNRI like venlafaxine. This condition requires prompt recognition and treatment to prevent serious complications such as serotonin syndrome.

In contrast, the other options are less likely:

- Abnormal ryanodine receptor (A) is associated with malignant hyperthermia, a rare but life-threatening medical emergency that can occur during general anesthesia.
- Dopamine receptor blockade (C) could be related to antipsychotic medications or certain antidepressants like risperidone, but it's not the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.
- Anticholinergic toxicity (D) is more commonly associated with medications like scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which are used for treating motion sickness, allergies, and urinary retention. It would not explain the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the answer is B. Increased CNS serotonergic activity.
