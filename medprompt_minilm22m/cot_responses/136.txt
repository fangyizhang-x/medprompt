## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Age and Presentation**: The patient is 48 years old and presents with a rapidly increasing left breast mass over 4 weeks. This rapid growth suggests a malignant process.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**:
   - Large dense breasts: This can be seen in several conditions, including fibroadenomas, phyllodes tumors, and invasive ductal carcinomas.
   - Multinodular mass: This is characteristic of fibroadenomas but can also be seen in other conditions like phyllodes tumors or invasive ductal carcinomas.
   - No skin changes or nipple changes: This helps to rule out some benign conditions.

3. **Mammography Findings**: The mammogram shows a smooth polylobulated mass, which is more suggestive of fibroadenoma rather than invasive ductal carcinoma or phyllodes tumors.

4. **Biopsy Specimen**:
   - Although the specific findings from the biopsy are not described, given the context, it's likely that the specimen would show features consistent with a benign process like fibroadenoma (e.g., well-differentiated cells, low mitotic rate).

5. **Differential Diagnosis Based on Options**:
   - A. Comedocarcinoma: This is a type of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) that presents as a solid mass with microcalcifications and is more common in younger women.
   - B. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma: Typically presents as a hard, irregular mass with skin changes or nipple discharge, which doesn't match the patient's presentation.
   - C. Fibroadenoma: This is a benign tumor of the breast that matches the patient's clinical and mammographic findings.
   - D. Phyllodes Tumor: These are rare tumors that can be benign (pleomorphic adenoma) or malignant (undifferentiated, well-differentiated, or dedifferentiated). The rapid growth and smooth appearance on mammography make phyllodes tumor less likely.

Given the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is a fibroadenoma due to its characteristic presentation of a rapidly growing, large, dense mass in the breast with no skin changes or nipple involvement.
