## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, including obvious signs of trauma to the chest and abdomen, an open deformity of the left femur, and the inability to open his eyes or withdraw to pain, it is clear that this patient has suffered a severe injury. The presence of an open deformity of the left femur suggests a high-energy trauma, such as a fracture with significant soft tissue damage.

The best initial step in management would be to ensure the patient's airway is secure and to assess for any life-threatening injuries. This can be achieved by performing a rapid sequence intubation (RSI) if the patient is unresponsive or not opening his eyes, which appears to be the case given his inability to open his eyes.

Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) involves administering two types of sedatives and an opioid to facilitate endotracheal intubation. This procedure is quick and effective in quickly securing the airway in emergency situations where time is critical.

While other options, such as emergency open fracture repair or exploratory laparoscopy, may be considered in certain contexts, they are not the best initial step in this scenario due to the patient's unstable condition and the need for rapid assessment of life-threatening injuries. Intubation is a crucial step in managing this patient's airway and ensuring his safety until further diagnostic evaluation can be performed.

Therefore, the answer is D.
