## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of sudden onset palpitations, sinus bradycardia, and elevated serum potassium level, along with his unremarkable physical examination and ECG findings, we can deduce that this patient is likely experiencing a condition known as hyperkalemic arrhythmia.

The key to answering this question lies in understanding the potential effects of various therapies on hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment to prevent cardiac arrest and other complications.

Option A, 50 mL of 50% glucose solution with 10 units of soluble insulin by intravenous infusion, is a standard treatment for hyperkalemia. Insulin stimulates the uptake of potassium into cells, which helps to lower serum potassium levels. This option is likely to be beneficial in this patient's condition.

Option B, 50 ml of Sodium bicarbonate (8.4%), may seem like an appropriate choice given its ability to help shift potassium ions out of cells and into the bloodstream. However, sodium bicarbonate can also cause a rapid increase in serum potassium levels by promoting the excretion of potassium in the urine. This could potentially worsen hyperkalemia in this patient.

Option C, Calcium resonium (calcium gluconate), is used to treat severe hyperkalemia that is associated with cardiac arrest or other life-threatening conditions. It works by stabilizing cardiac membranes and preventing further arrhythmias. However, it does not lower serum potassium levels and may even worsen hyperkalemia in some cases.

Option D, Administering a β-antagonist, such as atropine or propranolol, is typically used to treat symptomatic bradycardia associated with hyperkalemia. However, it does not address the underlying cause of hyperkalemia and may even worsen cardiac arrhythmias.

Therefore, the answer is B. 50 ml of Sodium bicarbonate (8.4%). This option may worsen this patient’s condition by causing a rapid increase in serum potassium levels.
