## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine the origin of the artery that was injured during parathyroidectomy, we need to consider the anatomical relationships between the structures involved.

Firstly, let's identify the key structures in this scenario:

1. The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is a branch of the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X).
2. The artery that travels along this nerve is likely to be a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, which is a major artery that arises from the subclavian artery.

The thyrocervical trunk typically branches into three main arteries:

1. The superior thyroid artery
2. The inferior thyroid artery
3. The external carotid artery (specifically, its terminal branch, the lingual artery)

Given this information, we can conclude that the artery that was injured during parathyroidectomy is most likely to be the external carotid artery.

Therefore, the answer is C.
