## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Step 1: Analyzing the patient's symptoms and history
The patient presents with back pain, weakness in the bilateral lower extremities, left greater than right, hyporeflexia in the knee and ankle jerks bilaterally, and saddle anesthesia on rectal examination. These symptoms are suggestive of a spinal cord injury or compression.

### Step 2: Considering the patient's history
The patient has a history of metastatic prostate cancer and was not a candidate for surgical resection due to his unremitting nausea. This information is relevant because it suggests that the patient may have had previous spinal cord injuries, which could be related to his current symptoms.

### Step 3: Evaluating the patient's current presentation
The patient's symptoms are consistent with cauda equina syndrome (CES), a condition characterized by nerve root compression or injury leading to lower extremity weakness, sensory changes, and autonomic dysfunction. The presence of saddle anesthesia on rectal examination is particularly suggestive of CES.

### Step 4: Determining the appropriate next step in management
Given the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is cauda equina syndrome (CES). The appropriate next step in management would be to perform an MRI to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the injury. Steroids may be used to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage.

### Step 5: Considering the options
Option A suggests starting steroids prior to MRI, which is not recommended as it delays diagnosis and treatment. Option B suggests starting steroids after MRI, which may also delay diagnosis and treatment. Option C suggests rushing the patient to radiation therapy, which is not a standard treatment for CES. Option D suggests starting steroids prior to MRI, which aligns with current medical guidelines.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
