## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To answer this question, let's break down the key points and understand the developmental stages involved in embryonic development.

1. **Fertilization**: This occurs when a sperm fertilizes an egg. In humans, fertilization typically happens within 24 hours after ovulation.
2. **Morula formation**: After fertilization, the zygote undergoes several cleavage divisions without significant growth, forming a compact cluster of cells called a morula. This process usually takes around 3-4 days post-fertilization.
3. **Blastocyst formation**: As the morula continues to develop, it undergoes further cell division and differentiation into two distinct groups: the inner cell mass (ICM) and the trophoblast. The ICM will eventually form the fetus, while the trophoblast will contribute to the placenta.
4. **Embryonic development**: After fertilization, the morula begins to divide into two distinct groups of cells, one for each blastocyst. This process is called gastrulation.

Given that the ultrasound reveals separate amniotic sacs and a shared chorion and placenta in twins with a common placenta, we can infer that these are dizygotic (fraternal) twins, as they share only half of their genetic material.

The morula stage typically occurs around 3-4 days post-fertilization. Since the twins have separate amniotic sacs but share a chorion and placenta, it suggests that the morula divided into two distinct groups before this point in time.

Considering the developmental stages mentioned above:

- **Days 4-8**: This is too early for the morula to divide into two distinct groups.
- **Days 9-12**: The blastocyst stage begins around this time, but the morula division has not occurred yet.
- **Days 13-15**: This is still within the morula stage, and it's unlikely that the morula would have divided into two distinct groups by this point.
- **Day 16+**: This is after the gastrulation stage, which occurs around 3-4 days post-fertilization. The morula has already divided into two distinct groups before this time.

Therefore, based on the developmental stages and the information provided in the question, the correct answer is:

## Answer
(A) Days 4-8
