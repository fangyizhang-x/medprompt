## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the information provided, let's break down the key points to understand the patient's condition:

1. **Age and Gender**: The patient is an 18-year-old male.
2. **Symptoms**:
   - Binge eating during times of stress (particularly exams).
   - Feeling guilty about binge eating.
   - Attempting to compensate for binge eating by going to the gym excessively (4+ hours per day).
3. **Physical Examination Findings**:
   - Temperature: 36.8 deg C (98.2 deg F), indicating mild fever, which could be related to stress or an underlying medical condition.
   - Pulse: 74/min, slightly elevated, but not significantly high for a healthy individual of this age and gender.
   - Blood Pressure: 122/68 mmHg, within the normal range for his age and sex.
4. **BMI**: 24, which falls into the normal weight category.

Considering these points:

- The patient's symptoms are primarily related to binge eating during stressful periods, followed by excessive exercise as a compensatory behavior. This pattern is characteristic of bulimia nervosa, an eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating and compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting or laxative abuse.
- There is no mention of purging behaviors (vomiting), which are typically associated with bulimia nervosa.
- The patient's physical examination findings do not suggest any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to his symptoms, making hypomania (a milder form of mania) or body dysmorphic disorder less likely.
- Normal behavior variant might not fully capture the complexity and severity of the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is bulimia nervosa.
