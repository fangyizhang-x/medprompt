## Step 1: Understand the stages of change in the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) of behavior change.
The TTM is a model that describes the process of changing behaviors, including smoking cessation. It consists of five stages: Precontemplation, Contemplation, Preparation, Action, and Maintenance.

## Step 2: Identify the current stage of the man's behavior change process.
Given that the man has been resistant to quitting in the past but is now willing to talk about it with his wife, we can infer that he is currently at a point where he acknowledges his desire to quit smoking. This suggests that he is not yet considering quitting as a long-term solution (Precontemplation), nor is he actively preparing for quitting (Preparation). He also does not seem to be in the Action stage, where he has already started making plans or taking steps towards quitting.

## Step 3: Determine which stage best describes the man's current behavior.
Based on the information provided and the understanding of the TTM stages, the man is most likely at the Contemplation stage. This stage involves considering the possibility of changing a behavior but not yet committing to it as a long-term solution.

The final answer is: $\boxed{B}$
