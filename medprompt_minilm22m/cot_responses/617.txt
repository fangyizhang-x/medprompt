(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, this 2-year-old boy is likely suffering from a septic arthritis of the hip, which is a serious condition that requires prompt treatment to prevent further complications.

The key points in this case are:

1. The patient's symptoms, including fever, pain in the left lower extremity, refusal to walk, poor appetite, and limited range of motion, suggest an infectious process.
2. The laboratory findings, including elevated leukocyte count (19,800/mm^3), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (55 mm/h), and CRP (15 mg/L), indicate a significant inflammatory response.
3. The physical examination findings, including tenderness in the left hip with limited range of motion and severe discomfort on minimal attempts to rotate the hip, further support the diagnosis of septic arthritis.

The widened acetabular space on the left side on X-ray is also consistent with septic arthritis.

Considering these points, the most appropriate next step in management would be:

C. Arthroscopic drainage of hip

Arthroscopic drainage is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting a small camera and instruments through small incisions to drain the joint fluid and relieve pressure on the joint. This approach can be effective in treating septic arthritis, especially when other treatments have failed or are not feasible.

The other options are not as appropriate:

A. Vancomycin therapy: While vancomycin is an antibiotic that may be used to treat septic arthritis, it is typically reserved for cases where other antibiotics have failed or are not suitable.

B. Synovial fluid drainage plus cefazolin therapy: Cefazolin is a penicillin antibiotic that may be used in some cases of septic arthritis, but it is not the first-line treatment and may not be effective against all types of bacteria.

D. Doxycycline therapy: Doxycycline is an oral antibiotic that may be used to treat certain types of bacterial infections, including osteomyelitis (bone infection). However, it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for septic arthritis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be arthroscopic drainage of the hip.
