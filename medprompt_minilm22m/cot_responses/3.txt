## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The presence of fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery in a specimen from a patient who died suddenly with cardiac arrest and developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure following surgery for a fractured femur suggests that the condition leading to death was related to the sudden increase in pulmonary vascular resistance.

1. **Fibrous connective tissue around the lumen**: This finding is indicative of fibrosis, which can be caused by various conditions including pulmonary hypertension (C), pulmonary ischemia (B), and thromboembolism (A). However, the context provided points more towards a condition that would cause sudden increase in pulmonary vascular resistance.

2. **Recent surgery for a fractured femur**: This is a critical clue. The patient underwent surgery 3 months prior to her death, which could have led to an inflammatory response or a complication related to the surgical procedure itself.

3. **Acute hypoxic respiratory failure and cardiac arrest following discharge from rehab**: These symptoms suggest that the condition causing the sudden increase in pulmonary vascular resistance was severe enough to cause acute right ventricular failure, leading to cardiac arrest.

4. **Histological examination of lung tissue showing fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery**: This finding is consistent with pulmonary hypertension (C), which can lead to fibrosis and thickening of the walls of small pulmonary arteries and arterioles, causing them to constrict and increase vascular resistance.

Given these points, the most likely pathogenesis for the present findings is **pulmonary hypertension**. Pulmonary hypertension would explain the sudden increase in pulmonary vascular resistance leading to acute right ventricular failure and cardiac arrest following surgery.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:
- Thromboembolism (A) might cause sudden death but typically does not result in fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery.
- Pulmonary ischemia (B) could also lead to acute right ventricular failure, but it would more likely present with signs of ischemia rather than fibrosis and increased vascular resistance.
- Pulmonary passive congestion (D) is a condition that might cause sudden death due to cardiac arrest, but it typically does not result in the formation of fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery.

Therefore, the answer is C.
