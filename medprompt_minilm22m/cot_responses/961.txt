## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Initial Assessment:
The urinalysis results show the presence of protein (1+), leukocyte esterase positivity, nitrite positivity, RBCs (red blood cells) at 2/hpf, WBCs (white blood cells) at 90/hpf, and WBC casts numerous. These findings are indicative of a urinary tract infection (UTI).

### Consideration of Options:
- **A. Treat on an outpatient basis with nitrofurantoin**: Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat UTIs caused by certain bacteria. However, it may not be effective against all types of bacteria and can have side effects.
- **B. Admit the patient and perform an CT scan of the abdomen**: While a CT scan might provide more detailed information about the kidneys and urinary tract, it is not typically necessary for initial management of uncomplicated UTIs.
- **C. Treat on an outpatient basis with ciprofloxacin**: Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can be effective against many types of bacteria causing UTIs. However, it may require more monitoring and adjustment in dosage due to potential side effects.
- **D. Admit the patient and treat with intravenous levofloxacin**: Levofloxacin is a potent fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is often used for complicated or severe UTIs, as well as for patients who are allergic to other antibiotics.

### Reasoning:
Given the presence of RBCs (indicating a possible urinary tract infection) and WBC casts (suggestive of pyelonephritis), which is an inflammation of the kidney, the most appropriate next step would be to treat on an outpatient basis with a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can effectively cover for potential pathogens. Among the options provided, **A** (treat on an outpatient basis with nitrofurantoin) and **C** (treat on an outpatient basis with ciprofloxacin) are both reasonable choices. However, considering the severity of the symptoms and the need to monitor for potential complications like pyelonephritis, **D** (admit the patient and treat with intravenous levofloxacin) might be more appropriate in some cases.

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided and the typical management strategies for uncomplicated UTIs, the most appropriate next step would be to admit the patient and treat with an antibiotic that
