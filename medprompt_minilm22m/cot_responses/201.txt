## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history of recurrent respiratory exacerbations and current presentation, we can deduce that her condition is likely to be related to her chronic illness.

Firstly, the fact that she has had 4 respiratory exacerbations in the past year suggests that her cystic fibrosis (CF) is not well-controlled. This is consistent with the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain, which are common in patients with CF who have not received adequate treatment.

The presence of digital clubbing, increased anteroposterior chest diameter, decreased chest excursions and tactile fremitus on the right side, and diffuse wheezing over the left lung field further supports this diagnosis. These findings are characteristic of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), a complication of CF that can occur in patients who have not received adequate treatment.

The most likely underlying cause of this patient's current symptoms is therefore increased pulmonary capillary permeability (D). This condition occurs when there is an abnormal increase in the amount of fluid leaking into the lungs, which can be caused by various factors including inflammation, infection, and damage to the lung tissue. In CF patients with PF, the increased permeability leads to edema and fibrosis in the lungs, resulting in symptoms such as shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, and clubbing.

The other options are less likely:

A. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness is a common feature of asthma and COPD, but it does not explain the patient's chronic symptoms or the presence of PF.

B. Infection with gram-negative coccobacilli is unlikely to be the cause of this patient's current symptoms, given her history of recurrent respiratory exacerbations and lack of recent infection.

C. Apical subpleural cysts are a common feature of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with CF, but they do not explain the patient's chronic symptoms or the presence of PF.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's current symptoms is increased pulmonary capillary permeability.
