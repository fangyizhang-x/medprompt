## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, which include trouble sleeping, eating poorly, and feeling drained all the time, along with guilt over not doing more for her newborn, it is likely that she is experiencing symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD). PPD is a common complication of childbirth, affecting up to 1 in 7 new mothers.

The patient's feelings of guilt are also concerning, as they may be indicative of anxiety or low self-esteem. The fact that she stopped playing with the baby suggests that her usual level of engagement and interest in childcare has decreased.

Reassurance (A) is not sufficient as a treatment for PPD, as it does not address the underlying symptoms. Fluoxetine (B), an SSRI antidepressant, may be prescribed to treat mild to moderate depression but is not typically used as a first-line treatment for PPD. Amitriptyline (C), a tricyclic antidepressant, can also be used to treat depression but is not usually recommended for postpartum women due to its potential side effects.

The most effective treatment for PPD is psychotherapy, specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT). These therapies can help the patient identify and change negative thought patterns, develop coping skills, and improve her overall well-being. In some cases, medication may be prescribed in conjunction with psychotherapy to help manage symptoms.

Therefore, the best course of treatment for this patient would be psychotherapy, specifically CBT or IPT, which is often recommended as a first-line treatment for PPD.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that women with suspected PPD receive immediate attention and treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) also supports the use of psychotherapy as a first-line treatment for PPD.

In summary, while reassurance is important, it should not be the sole treatment approach for this patient. A comprehensive treatment plan that includes psychotherapy should be implemented to address her symptoms and improve her mental health.
