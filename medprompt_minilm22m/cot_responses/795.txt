Given the patient's presentation of deep heel pain that worsens with activity and improves with rest, this is suggestive of a condition known as plantar fasciitis. This condition is common in individuals who engage in repetitive activities such as ballet, which can cause micro-tears in the plantar fascia, leading to inflammation and pain.

The patient's occupation as a professional ballerina further supports the likelihood of plantar fasciitis, as it involves repetitive stress on the foot and ankle. The fact that she is concerned about appearing in a new ballet next week also suggests that her symptoms are impacting her performance.

Considering the patient's age (24 years) and lack of past medical history, family history, or significant lifestyle factors, it is less likely that other conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, or rheumatoid arthritis would be contributing to her symptoms. Additionally, given her current level of physical activity and occupation, a more acute condition like tendinitis or bursitis is less likely.

Given the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis, the best next step in management would be to provide pain relief and promote healing. Resting the foot and avoiding activities that exacerbate the pain are essential components of treatment. Orthotic shoe inserts may also be beneficial in alleviating symptoms by providing support and reducing stress on the plantar fascia.

Option B (Glucocorticoid injection) is not typically recommended for acute conditions like plantar fasciitis, as it can potentially worsen inflammation and prolong recovery time. Option C (Plain radiograph of the foot) may be useful in diagnosing other conditions such as heel spurs or fractures, but it does not address the patient's current symptoms or provide relief from pain.

Therefore, the best next step in management for this patient with plantar fasciitis is to recommend resting the foot and avoiding activities that exacerbate the pain.
