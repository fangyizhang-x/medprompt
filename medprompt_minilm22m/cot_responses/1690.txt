Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, this 4-year-old girl is likely suffering from a hemolytic anemia, specifically hereditary spherocytosis (HS), given the round, smaller size of red blood cells without central pallor on peripheral smear. The presence of mild splenomegaly further supports this diagnosis.

The most sensitive test for confirming HS would be one that can directly assess the structure and function of red blood cells, which are affected in this condition. Let's evaluate each option:

A. Osmotic fragility test: This test is used to detect hereditary spherocytosis by assessing the osmotic fragility of red blood cells. However, it does not provide information about the cell membrane structure or function.

B. Coombs test (Direct and Indirect Antiglobulin Test): While this test can help identify autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which is a different condition from HS, it may not be as sensitive for detecting the specific changes in red blood cells seen in HS.

C. Eosin-5-maleimide binding test: This test is used to detect the presence of abnormal proteins (anisocytins) that are associated with hereditary spherocytosis. However, it requires a sample of red blood cells and may not be as sensitive or specific for diagnosing HS.

D. Hemoglobin electrophoresis: This test can help identify the type of hemoglobin present in the blood (e.g., HbA2, HbF) and is particularly useful in diagnosing hereditary spherocytosis, which often involves a reduction in HbA2 levels. It provides information about the structure and function of red blood cells, making it the most sensitive test for confirming HS.

Therefore, considering the clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggestive of hereditary spherocytosis, hemoglobin electrophoresis is the most appropriate choice for confirming this patient's condition.
