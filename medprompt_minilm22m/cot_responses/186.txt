## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, including progressive unilateral nasal obstruction, bloody nasal discharge, double vision (diplopia), and a history of occasional sore throats, we can consider several potential causes. However, considering the age of the patient and his presentation, we should also think about viral infections that are more common in older adults.

The key findings here include:

- The patient's symptoms have progressed over 10 months, suggesting an ongoing infection.
- The presence of bloody nasal discharge is a significant finding, which can be associated with several conditions but is particularly concerning for certain types of infections.
- Double vision (diplopia) could be related to the involvement of cranial nerves or the compression of these nerves by the nasal obstruction.

Considering these points:

- **Human Papillomavirus (HPV)**: While HPV can cause various respiratory and ocular symptoms, it is less commonly associated with progressive unilateral nasal obstruction and bloody nasal discharge.
  
- **HIV**: HIV infection can lead to a variety of opportunistic infections, but the presentation described here does not strongly suggest an HIV-related condition.

- **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)**: EBV is known for causing infectious mononucleosis (mono), which can present with fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy. However, it typically does not cause progressive unilateral nasal obstruction or bloody nasal discharge.

- **Human T Lymphotropic Virus Type I (HTLV-I)**: HTLV-I is associated with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and certain types of hairy cell leukemia. While these conditions can present with a variety of symptoms, they are less commonly linked to the specific combination of symptoms described in this patient.

Given the age of the patient, his presentation, and the lack of other significant findings, **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)** is the most likely viral etiology associated with the development of this patient's condition. EBV can cause infectious mononucleosis, which may present with symptoms similar to those described in this case.

Therefore, the answer is C.
