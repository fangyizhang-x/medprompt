## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's complaint of decreased vision in one eye, particularly after covering her left eye due to an itch, this scenario suggests a transient visual disturbance rather than a chronic condition like optic neuritis or inflammation.

Firstly, the fact that she was watching television and then covered her left eye without any precipitating event (e.g., trauma, infection) makes it less likely for conditions such as optic neuritis, which often have a clear trigger. Similarly, the absence of pain, swelling, flashes, floaters, or headaches makes conditions like acute ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) and posterior ischemic retinopathy (PIR) less likely.

The patient's past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension is also relevant because it increases her risk for atherosclerotic disease, which can lead to embolic events. The fact that she takes nitroglycerin as needed suggests she may be on medications that could increase the risk of thromboembolism.

Given these considerations, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is occlusion of the ophthalmic artery by an embolus. This can occur due to atherosclerosis or other vascular diseases and would lead to sudden loss of vision in one eye without any preceding trauma or inflammation.

The fundus examination findings of generalized pallor and slight disc edema with no hemorrhages further support this diagnosis, as these are common signs of ischemia.

Therefore, the answer is C.
