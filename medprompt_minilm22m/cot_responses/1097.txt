(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history and allergies, we need to consider which contraceptive methods would be contraindicated due to her latex allergy and copper use.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option:

A. Diaphragm with spermicide: This is a non-hormonal method that does not contain latex or copper, making it suitable for this patient.
B. Progestin-only pill (POP): While POPs are generally safe, they do contain copper, which may be problematic given the patient's allergy to copper. However, some progestin-only pills are now available with lower levels of copper or without copper altogether.
C. Intrauterine device (IUD): IUDs are a non-hormonal method that does not contain latex or copper, making them suitable for this patient.
D. Combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP): COCPs contain both estrogen and progestin, which means they do contain both estrogen and progestin. Given the patient's allergy to latex, this option is contraindicated.

Therefore, based on the patient's allergies and medical history, the only contraceptive method that is contraindicated in this patient is the Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill (COCP).

The final answer is: D
