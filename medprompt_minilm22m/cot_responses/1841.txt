## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of a 13-year-old boy with bleeding from his lips, multiple small dilated capillaries over various parts of the body (including the lips, nose, and fingers), and a family history of recurrent nosebleeds, we can deduce that this patient is likely suffering from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). HHT is a genetic disorder characterized by the formation of abnormal blood vessels, which can lead to various symptoms including nosebleeds, skin lesions, and gastrointestinal problems.

The presence of multiple small dilated capillaries over the lips, nose, and fingers is particularly suggestive of HHT. These capillary dilations are often referred to as telangiectasias and can be seen in both the skin and mucous membranes.

Given this diagnosis, we need to consider which condition this patient would be at increased risk for:

A. Glaucoma - While glaucoma can cause eye damage and vision loss, it is not directly related to HHT or the symptoms described.

B. Renal cell carcinoma - This type of cancer is more commonly associated with other conditions such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or Lynch syndrome, rather than HHT.

C. High-output cardiac failure - Patients with HHT are actually at increased risk for heart problems due to the abnormal blood vessels that can lead to high blood pressure and cardiac damage over time. This condition is often referred to as "vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome" (vEDS).

D. Gastrointestinal polyps - While patients with HHT may have an increased risk of certain gastrointestinal conditions, such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis, the direct link between HHT and gastrointestinal polyps is not as clear-cut.

Therefore, considering the patient's diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and its associated symptoms, the most accurate answer would be:

## Answer
(C. High-output cardiac failure)
