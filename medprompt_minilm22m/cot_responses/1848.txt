Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, let's break down the key points:

1. **Age and Ethnicity**: The patient is a 4-year-old African-American girl, which may influence her likelihood of certain conditions.
2. **Symptoms**: Bilateral leg pain that is crampy in nature, lasts up to an hour, and occurs primarily before bedtime. Waking up crying due to severe pain also suggests nocturnal pain.
3. **Reduced Pain with Massage**: The fact that the pain is reduced when her mother massages her legs may indicate a condition that responds to physical manipulation or gentle pressure.
4. **No Pain at School or Play**: This suggests that the pain might not be related to daily activities, which could help rule out conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or other functional disorders.
5. **Family History**: The patient's mother has rheumatoid arthritis, but there is no direct family history of autoimmune diseases or musculoskeletal conditions in this case.

Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is **Fibromyalgia**. Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread muscle pain, fatigue, and tender points on the body. It often begins in childhood or adolescence but can persist into adulthood.

Given the patient's age, symptoms, and lack of response to massage, fibromyalgia is a strong consideration. The other options are less likely:

- **Antinuclear Antibody (ANA)**: ANA is typically used to diagnose autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or scleroderma.
- **Pramipexole Therapy**: Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome. While it might help with pain management, it's not the most appropriate next step for this patient.
- **X-ray of the Lower Extremities**: An X-ray would be more relevant if there were signs of bone or joint abnormalities, which are not indicated here.

Therefore, the most appropriate next best step in management is to confirm the diagnosis with a definitive test. The American College of Rheumatology recommends that patients with fibromyalgia undergo a comprehensive evaluation, including:

- **Medical History and Physical Examination**: To rule out other conditions.
- **Dermatological Examination**: For signs of skin changes or rashes.
- **Neuropsychiatric Evaluation**: To
