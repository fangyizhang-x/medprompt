Given the clinical presentation of this 6-year-old girl, it is essential to consider her history of asthma exacerbations and the current symptoms of irritation, redness, profuse tearing, sticky eyes, difficulty opening eyes in the morning, tender preauricular lymph node, chemosis, diffuse erythema of the bulbar conjunctiva, follicular reaction, and fine epithelial keratitis. These findings suggest an allergic or inflammatory condition affecting her eyes.

The presence of a tender preauricular lymph node could indicate an infectious process such as conjunctivitis or another form of pharyngitis that has spread to the eye. The diffuse erythema of the bulbar conjunctiva and follicular reaction in both palpebral conjunctivae are indicative of an allergic or inflammatory condition.

Considering her asthma history, it is crucial to avoid using corticosteroids on her eyes without a valid medical reason, as they can exacerbate asthma. Therefore, we need to consider whether the current symptoms could be related to an allergic reaction rather than an infectious one.

The options provided for management are:

A. Supportive therapy
B. Topical prednisolone acetate
C. Topical natamycin
D. Topical erythromycin

Given her asthma history, we should avoid using topical corticosteroids on her eyes without a valid medical reason. However, the presence of follicular reaction and fine epithelial keratitis suggests an allergic or inflammatory condition.

Topical prednisolone acetate (B) is a potent corticosteroid that could be used to treat severe inflammation but should only be considered if there are no other options available for managing her symptoms. Topical natamycin (C) is an antifungal medication that may not be the best choice in this scenario, as it does not address the likely allergic or inflammatory cause of her symptoms.

Topical erythromycin (D) is a macrolide antibiotic that could be used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis but would not address the likely allergic or inflammatory cause of her symptoms.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient would be supportive therapy (A), which may include providing symptomatic relief such as lubricating eye drops and avoiding further irritation. However, given the potential for an allergic reaction, it is essential to monitor her closely for signs of worsening symptoms or complications.

The final answer is
