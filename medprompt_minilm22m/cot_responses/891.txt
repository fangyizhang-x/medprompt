## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, let's analyze each option step by step:

A. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) >70% - While an elevated PEFR can indicate asthma exacerbation or worsening, it does not necessarily categorize the condition as life-threatening. In fact, a PEFR of 80-90% is generally considered normal for most adults.

B. Dyspnea that limits usual daily activity - This option is crucial. The patient reports prior exposure to a person with symptoms of a respiratory infection and now presents with worsening cough, wheezes, and chest tightness. Dyspnea (difficulty breathing) that limits usual daily activities indicates an acute exacerbation of asthma, which can be life-threatening if not promptly managed.

C. Symptoms lasting for > 3 days after starting treatment - While persistent symptoms are concerning, the fact that these have been worsening over the last 2 days suggests a recent exacerbation rather than a chronic condition. The duration of symptoms is also not sufficient to categorize this as life-threatening.

D. Respiratory acidosis - This option is not directly relevant to the patient's current presentation. While respiratory acidosis can be a complication of severe asthma exacerbations, it does not categorize the condition as life-threatening in itself.

Considering these factors, the most critical aspect of the patient's presentation that categorizes his condition as life-threatening is the presence of dyspnea that limits usual daily activities, indicating an acute exacerbation of asthma. This option directly addresses the severity and impact of the patient's symptoms on his quality of life.

The final answer is: B
