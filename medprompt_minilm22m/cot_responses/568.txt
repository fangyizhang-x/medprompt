Given the clinical presentation and physical examination findings, the most likely scenario is that the patient has ingested a battery, which can cause severe harm or even death if not treated promptly.

The presence of a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur loudest at the left lower sternal border could be indicative of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which is a common complication in neonates and infants who have ingested foreign bodies, including batteries. The murmur suggests increased flow across the pulmonary valve, which can occur due to the obstruction caused by the battery.

The absence of vomiting or hematemesis does not rule out the possibility of internal bleeding from the battery, although it is less likely given the patient's age and the fact that there are no signs of peritonitis (inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity).

Considering these factors, the most appropriate next step in management would be to induce emesis to expel the battery. This is because:

* The presence of a PDA increases the risk of bleeding from the battery, and inducing emesis can help reduce this risk by allowing the stomach contents to pass through the gastrointestinal tract without causing further irritation or damage.
* Inducing emesis also reduces the likelihood of aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs, which could exacerbate respiratory distress.

The other options are not as immediately appropriate:

* B (Induce gastrointestinal motility with metoclopramide) may be considered if there were concerns about bowel obstruction or perforation, but it is not the most direct way to address the suspected battery ingestion.
* C (Computed tomography scan to confirm the diagnosis) could provide valuable information about the extent of any internal injuries, but it is not necessary given the clinical presentation and physical examination findings.
* D (Immediate endoscopic removal) may be considered if there were concerns about a perforated viscus or severe bleeding, but it is not the most appropriate initial step in this case.

Therefore, the best course of action is to induce emesis to expel the battery.
