To answer this question, let's consider the regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic pathway that results in the generation of glucose from certain non-carbohydrate carbon substrates such as lactate, glycerol, and glucogenic amino acids. The balance between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis is tightly regulated to maintain blood glucose levels within a narrow range.

One key molecule involved in this regulation is fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (FDB). FDB is a potent activator of the phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) enzyme, which is a key regulatory step in glycolysis. When FDB levels are high, it promotes glycolysis by increasing the activity of PFK-1.

On the other hand, insulin is a hormone that inhibits gluconeogenesis and promotes glycolysis. Insulin binds to its receptors on the surface of cells, triggering a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to the inhibition of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis.

Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (C) is an allosteric activator of PFK-1, which means it increases the activity of this enzyme. When FDB levels are high, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate binds to and activates PFK-1, promoting glycolysis.

Acetyl-CoA (D), on the other hand, is a product of fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis. While acetyl-CoA can inhibit gluconeogenesis by inhibiting the activity of key enzymes involved in this pathway, it does not directly promote gluconeogenesis.

Therefore, considering the regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, increased concentration of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate would promote gluconeogenesis.
