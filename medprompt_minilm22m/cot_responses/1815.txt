Given the patient's history of using intravenous heroin and his current desire for cosmetic removal of the swelling, it is essential to approach this situation with caution.

Firstly, the presence of healed track marks in the bilateral cubital fossae suggests that the patient has a history of injecting drugs. This information raises concerns about potential infections or other complications related to needle use, which should be considered when evaluating the patient's overall health and risk tolerance for surgery.

The fact that the mass on his back is described as soft, lobulated, mobile, and slips away from the fingers upon palpation is highly suggestive of a lipoma. Lipomas are benign tumors composed of fat tissue, typically found in adults, and are generally not considered a medical emergency.

However, the patient's desire for cosmetic removal despite these concerns raises questions about his motivations and potential risk tolerance. It is also worth noting that the patient has previously expressed discomfort with the excision procedure due to its potential risks and recurrence.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate next step in management would be to refer him to a specialist who can provide guidance on the best course of action for his specific situation. This could include a dermatologist or plastic surgeon specializing in cosmetic procedures, as they are more likely to have experience with lipomas and understand the patient's concerns.

Referring him to such a specialist will allow them to assess the patient's overall health, discuss potential risks and benefits of treatment, and provide guidance on the most appropriate management plan. This approach prioritizes the patient's safety while also respecting his autonomy and preferences regarding cosmetic procedures.

In contrast, options A (Perform the excision), B (Refer to the hospital ethics committee), and C (Refere him to a methadone clinic) do not address the underlying concerns about the patient's health and risk tolerance for surgery. Option D (Request parental consent) is also inappropriate as it would require the physician to consider the parents' wishes over the patient's medical needs.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to refer him to a specialist who can provide guidance on the best course of action for his specific situation.
