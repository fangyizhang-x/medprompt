## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, including a history of hypertension, intermittent atrial fibrillation, and stable angina pectoris, as well as her current symptoms such as dizziness shortly before falling, it is reasonable to consider a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) as a potential cause. The physical exam findings of a dry tongue and the pinched skin on the back of her hand that unfolds after 2 seconds are particularly suggestive of a TIA.

The history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk for embolic events, which could explain the patient's symptoms. Atrial fibrillation can lead to blood clots forming in the heart, which can then travel to other parts of the body and cause a stroke or TIA.

Considering the options provided:

A. Absent P waves on ECG - This is consistent with atrial fibrillation, as it would affect the normal rhythm of the heart.

B. Elevated blood urea nitrogen concentration - While this could be related to various conditions, there is no direct link between elevated BUN and a TIA or stroke in this context.

C. Hypodense lesions on CT scan of the head - This finding is more suggestive of a subarachnoid hemorrhage or other space-occupying lesions, which are less likely given the patient's presentation.

D. Elevated serum creatine kinase concentration - While elevated CK levels can be seen in various conditions, including myocardial infarction and muscle damage, it is not directly related to a TIA or stroke in this context.

Therefore, considering the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the physical exam findings suggestive of a TIA, the most likely finding further evaluation would show is absent P waves on ECG.
