(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, including fever with rigors, headache, malaise, muscle pains, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, mild splenomegaly, and a positive microscopic examination for morulae in leukocytes on Wright-Giemsa stain, we can deduce that this patient likely has Lyme disease.

Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis). The presence of morulae in leukocytes on Wright-Giemsa stain is a specific laboratory finding that supports this diagnosis. 

Given the patient's recent exposure to ticks in Georgia and the symptoms described, it is likely that Lyme disease is the cause of his illness.

The most appropriate initial step in treating Lyme disease is to start with antibiotics that are effective against Borrelia burgdorferi. Among the options provided:

- A. Ceftriaxone: This is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including Borrelia burgdorferi.
- B. Doxycycline: This is a tetracycline antibiotic that is also effective against Borrelia burgdorferi and is often recommended as the first-line treatment for Lyme disease.
- C. Ciprofloxacin: This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is not typically used to treat Lyme disease, although it may be considered in certain cases where other antibiotics are ineffective or contraindicated.
- D. Rifampin: This is an rifamycin antibiotic that is effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and some other bacteria, but it is not the first-line treatment for Lyme disease.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the most appropriate initial step in treating this patient with Lyme disease would be to start with Doxycycline or Ceftriaxone.
