## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation with acute-onset fever, weakness, shifting neurologic deficits (including aphasia and motor deficits), significant reduction in urine output, laboratory findings indicating anemia (Hb 8.6 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (Platelets 43 Ã— 10^3/mm^3), renal impairment (elevated BUN and creatinine), metabolic acidosis (HCO3- 24 mg/dL), and the presence of schistocytes, helmet cells, and spherocytes in the peripheral smear, we can deduce that this patient is suffering from Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS).

The pathophysiology of HUS involves a complex interplay between immune-mediated mechanisms and vascular damage. The key features of HUS include:

1. **Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia**: This condition is characterized by the presence of schistocytes, helmet cells, and spherocytes in the peripheral smear due to mechanical destruction of red blood cells as they pass through small vessels with damaged endothelium.
2. **Thrombotic microangiopathy**: The formation of thrombi within the small vessels leads to renal failure, hemolytic anemia, and neurological symptoms.
3. **Renal impairment**: HUS is often associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), which can progress to chronic kidney disease.

Given these features, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **The condition is caused by the deficiency of a sodium transporter**: This statement is not accurate regarding HUS. The primary defect in HUS is related to the complement system and the formation of thrombi within small vessels, rather than a deficiency in a sodium transporter.

B. **Bleeding time will be normal**: In HUS, bleeding time is typically prolonged due to platelet dysfunction and microvascular thrombosis.

C. **Splenectomy should be performed as early as possible**: While splenectomy may be considered in some cases of HUS (e.g., when there are recurrent episodes), it is not the primary treatment for this condition. The mainstay of treatment involves addressing the underlying cause, which includes correcting the underlying hemolytic anemia and managing renal impairment.

D. **Plasmapheresis is the treatment of choice**: Plasmapheresis (also known as plasmavastin) is indeed considered a treatment option for HUS,
