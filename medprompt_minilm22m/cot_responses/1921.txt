To understand the mechanism of action of the antineoplastic drug that the patient will receive, we need to consider the context of concurrent chemoradiation therapy for stage 3 squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.

Firstly, it's essential to recognize that chemotherapy and radiation therapy are complementary treatments used in conjunction with each other. Chemotherapy aims to target rapidly dividing cancer cells, while radiation therapy targets more slowly dividing cells.

The key concept here is the synergistic effect between chemotherapy and radiation therapy. When these two therapies are combined, they can enhance their individual effects, leading to a more effective treatment outcome than either modality alone.

Now, let's consider the options provided:

A. Inhibition of polymerization of tubulin - This mechanism is characteristic of taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel), which work by inhibiting microtubule dynamics. While taxanes are effective in treating various cancers, they are not typically associated with the synergistic effect seen with concurrent chemoradiation therapy.

B. Inhibition of topoisomerase 2 - This mechanism is characteristic of platinum-based antineoplastic drugs (e.g., cisplatin), which work by forming interstrand DNA cross-links. These cross-links can lead to DNA damage, triggering apoptosis in cancer cells. However, the question asks about a drug that will be receiving intravenous cisplatin.

C. Formation of interstrand DNA cross-links - This is the correct mechanism of action for the antineoplastic drug that the patient will receive. Cisplatin works by forming covalent bonds between the platinum molecule and the DNA, leading to the formation of interstrand DNA cross-links. These cross-links are highly toxic to rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells.

D. Free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation - This mechanism is characteristic of certain antineoplastic drugs (e.g., doxorubicin), which work by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage cellular components. However, this is not the primary mechanism of action for cisplatin.

Therefore, based on the context of concurrent chemoradiation therapy and the known mechanisms of action for these types of antineoplastic drugs, the best explanation for the mechanism of action of the antineoplastic drug that the patient will receive is:
