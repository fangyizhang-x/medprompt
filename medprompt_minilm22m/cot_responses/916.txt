## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and how they relate to Crohn disease:

1. **Periodic bloody diarrhea**: This symptom is non-specific but can be associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn disease.
2. **Sigmoid colon inflammation on colonoscopy**: This finding supports the diagnosis of an IBD, as it indicates involvement of the terminal ileum and beginning of the colon.
3. **Joint pain in knees and ankles**: This symptom can be associated with inflammatory arthritis, which is a common extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn disease.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Left lower quadrant pain**: While left lower quadrant pain can be associated with IBD, it is not specific to Crohn disease. Other conditions like appendicitis or diverticulitis could also cause this symptom.

B. **Loss of large bowel haustra**: This finding is more typical of ulcerative colitis (UC), which typically causes a loss of haustra due to chronic inflammation and ulceration of the colon mucosa. Crohn disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, including the colon, but it often causes skip lesions or transmural involvement.

C. **Mucosal and submucosal ulcerations**: This finding is characteristic of Crohn disease. The presence of ulcers in the affected segment of the intestine is a hallmark of Crohn disease, distinguishing it from UC.

D. **Perianal fistula**: While perianal fistulas can occur in both IBDs (especially Crohn disease) and UC, they are not specific to Crohn disease. Other conditions like ulcerative proctitis or fistulizing IBD could also cause this symptom.

Based on the analysis above, the answer that suggests a diagnosis of Crohn disease is the presence of **mucosal and submucosal ulcerations** (C).
