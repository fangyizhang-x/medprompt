Given the patient's symptoms and history, including fever, chills, malaise, back pain on the right upper arm, recent forest expedition, and exposure to ticks, we can deduce that this patient is likely suffering from Lyme disease. The rash described in the image is characteristic of erythema migrans, a hallmark symptom of Lyme disease.

The best course of treatment for Lyme disease is typically doxycycline, which is an antibiotic that effectively treats the infection and prevents its spread to other parts of the body. Doxycycline is usually prescribed for 2 weeks, but in some cases, it may be extended for up to 4 weeks.

In contrast, azithromycin (A) is typically used to treat respiratory tract infections or certain skin conditions like acne, and it's not the first-line treatment for Lyme disease. Fluconazole (C) is an antifungal medication that would be more appropriate if the patient had a fungal infection, which is not indicated in this scenario. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (D) is also an antibiotic but is typically used to treat bacterial infections such as urinary tract infections or pneumonia.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the best course of treatment for Lyme disease would be doxycycline.
