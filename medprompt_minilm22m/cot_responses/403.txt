## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, we can approach this question by considering the key features:

1. **Recent travel history**: The patient returned from summer camp one week ago, which increases the risk for certain infections.
2. **Symptoms**: Worsening fever, headache, photophobia, nausea, maculopapular rash, rigidity of the neck, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings that suggest meningitis or encephalitis.
3. **Physical examination**: The presence of a maculopapular rash and neck stiffness is particularly suggestive of meningitis.

Considering these features, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Echovirus**: Echoviruses are common causes of viral infections in children, including encephalitis and meningitis. However, they typically cause more mild symptoms compared to other options listed here.

B. **Listeria monocytogenes**: Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by Listeria bacteria, which can affect people of all ages but is particularly concerning for pregnant women, older adults, and individuals with weakened immune systems. The presentation in this case (fever, headache, rash) could be consistent with listeriosis.

C. **Streptococcus pneumoniae**: While pneumococcal infections are common in children, they typically cause more severe symptoms such as pneumonia or meningitis, especially in older children and adults.

D. **Neisseria meningitidis**: Neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and sepsis in young children. However, the presentation might be less typical for this organism compared to Listeria monocytogenes, as it often causes more severe symptoms such as high fever, headache, and stiff neck.

Given these considerations, the most likely causal organism in this case is **B. Listeria monocytogenes**, due to its association with meningitis and encephalitis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals or those with a history of travel to areas where listeriosis is common (e.g., summer camps).

The final answer is: B
