The clinical presentation of this 5-week-old infant boy with intermittent vomiting that immediately follows feeding, hunger after vomiting, and a firm mass in the abdomen is highly suggestive of pyloric stenosis.

1. **Symptoms**: The symptoms of non-bilious vomiting immediately following feeding are classic for pyloric stenosis. This condition is characterized by obstruction of the pylorus, leading to gastric outlet obstruction.
2. **Vital signs and examination findings**: The normal vital signs and the presence of a firm mass in the abdomen with a movable, olive-shaped, and hard texture on palpation further support the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis.
3. **Age and presentation**: Pyloric stenosis typically presents in infants around 2-8 weeks of age, which fits this infant's age.
4. **Differential diagnoses**: Other conditions that could present with similar symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), intestinal obstruction, or congenital anomalies.

Given the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis, the most appropriate surgical treatment is a procedure that aims to relieve the obstruction by creating a new pathway for food to pass from the stomach into the small intestine. The options provided can be evaluated as follows:

A. **Surgical ligation of the fistula and primary end-to-end anastomosis of the esophagus**: This option involves creating a new connection between the esophagus and the stomach (fistula) to bypass the obstruction, followed by an end-to-end anastomosis to reconnect the two parts. This is a common surgical approach for pyloric stenosis.

B. **Pyloromyotomy**: This procedure involves making a longitudinal incision in the pylorus muscle to reduce the thickness of the muscular wall and improve gastric emptying. While it can be effective, it may not always relieve the obstruction completely and is often considered as an adjunctive treatment.

C. **Duodenoduodenostomy**: This surgical procedure involves creating a direct connection between the duodenum and jejunum to bypass the obstruction. It's typically reserved for cases where pyloric stenosis does not respond to medical management or when there are complications such as bleeding or perforation.

D. **Endorectal pull-through procedure**: This is a more complex surgical procedure that involves creating an end-to-end anastomosis between the distal esophagus and rectum, typically
