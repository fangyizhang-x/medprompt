## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key elements:

1. **Symptoms and diagnosis**: The patient presents with severe headaches and flushing, but no other symptoms are reported. The only abnormal finding is a blood pressure of 175 mmHg/100 mmHg.
2. **Optimal treatment**: Surgical intervention is determined as the optimal treatment for this patient.

Given that surgical intervention is the optimal treatment, we can infer that the condition causing these symptoms is likely an endocrine disorder or a condition affecting the autonomic nervous system, given the presence of hypertension and flushing.

**Pharmacological options:**

- **Isoproterenol (A)**: This is a beta-adrenergic agonist used to treat bradycardia, asthma, and certain arrhythmias. It would not be appropriate for this scenario as it does not address the underlying condition causing hypertension and flushing.
  
- **Propranolol (B)**: A non-selective beta-blocker that can lower blood pressure by reducing heart rate and contractility. While it might help with some symptoms, it is not the most effective choice in this context.

- **Phentolamine (C)**: This is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist used to treat pheochromocytoma, a condition characterized by excessive catecholamine release leading to hypertension and other symptoms. Given that surgical intervention is optimal for this patient, phentolamine would be the most appropriate non-competitive inhibitor to administer before surgery.

- **Phenoxybenzamine (D)**: This is also an alpha-adrenergic antagonist but is typically used in combination with beta-blockers or other medications to control hypertension. It might not be as effective in this scenario, especially since phentolamine would be administered first.

Therefore, the noncompetitive inhibitor that should be administered prior to surgery is **Phentolamine** due to its specific use in treating pheochromocytoma and the need for immediate reduction of blood pressure before surgical intervention.
