## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most appropriate next step in management is to investigate the pancreatic mass and liver masses further.

Firstly, the presence of multiple skin lesions with ulceration, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, pale appearance, and elevated serum glucagon levels suggests a possible diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. The abdominal ultrasonography findings of a 5.6 cm hypoechoic mass in the pancreatic body and multiple small masses in the liver of variable echogenicity are consistent with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), particularly those that are metastatic to the liver.

The elevated serum glucagon levels, which can be caused by PNETs or other conditions such as gastrinomas, are a key finding. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results also suggest that she may have an underlying condition causing her Cushingoid features, such as Cushing's syndrome due to a PNET.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to investigate further for the presence of these masses using endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), which can provide more detailed images of the pancreatic and liver lesions. This will help determine if there are any metastatic lesions that require systemic treatment or if they can be managed with local therapies.

In contrast, measuring serum zinc levels (A) may not be directly relevant to this patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Administration of octreotide (C) is a treatment option for certain PNETs, but it would not be the first step in management given the presence of multiple skin lesions and other systemic symptoms. Measurement of glycated hemoglobin (D) is a measure of blood glucose control and is not directly relevant to this patient's presentation.

Therefore, the best answer is B.
