## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can evaluate each option as follows:

- **Syphilis (A)**: While syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can cause genital lesions, it typically presents with a painless chancre at the site of initial infection. The description provided does not match this classic presentation.
  
- **Gonorrhea (B)**: Gonorrhea is another STI that can cause genital lesions, but these are usually painful and may be accompanied by other symptoms such as burning during urination or a strong, unpleasant odor. The patient's description of painless red-rimmed, fluid-filled blisters does not align with gonorrhea.
  
- **Genital Herpes (C)**: Genital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and can present with painful genital lesions. However, these are typically vesicular or ulcerative rather than fluid-filled blisters. The patient's description of painless blisters does not fit this diagnosis.
  
- **Trichomoniasis (D)**: Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. It can cause a range of symptoms, including genital discharge, itching, and burning during urination. The patient's description of red-rimmed, fluid-filled blisters over the labia minora with swollen and tender inguinal lymph nodes is highly suggestive of trichomoniasis.

Given the combination of painful genital lesions (blisters) and swollen and tender inguinal lymph nodes in a sexually active woman with a history of inconsistent condom use, trichomoniasis is the most likely diagnosis. This condition can be asymptomatic for weeks or months before symptoms appear, which aligns with the patient's presentation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
