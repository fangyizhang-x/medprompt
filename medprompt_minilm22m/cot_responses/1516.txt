## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The phenomenon observed by the research scientist can be explained by the Bohr effect, which describes how changes in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood affect the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin.

1. Initially, with a low CO2 concentration (26 mmHg), there is little to no release of CO2 from hemoglobin into the bloodstream.
2. When CO2 is added to the dog's blood at a pressure of 90 mmHg, it causes an increase in CO2 levels within the lungs.
3. As a result of this increased CO2 concentration, the hemoglobin in the lungs binds more CO2 than oxygen, leading to a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen (O2) available for binding to hemoglobin.
4. This decrease in O2 availability causes a shift towards the release of CO2 from hemoglobin into the bloodstream, which is reflected by an increase in the partial pressure of CO2 in the blood.
5. The peripheral tissues, receiving this increased CO2 concentration, respond by facilitating the unloading of oxygen from hemoglobin through various mechanisms (e.g., increased ventilation, changes in pH levels), leading to an increase in the partial pressure of O2 available for binding to hemoglobin.

Therefore, the correct explanation is that the high partial pressure of CO2 in tissues facilitates O2 unloading in peripheral tissues.
