(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including jugular venous pulsations 9 cm above the sternal angle, a loud, split S2, an impulse felt with the fingers left of the sternum, pitting edema around the ankles, and pronounced central pulmonary arteries on the chest x-ray, the most likely diagnosis is pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's history of long-term smoking, emigration from Eastern Europe, and use of illicit substances increases her risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE. The presence of jugular venous pulsations and a loud, split S2 are classic signs of right heart strain, often seen in PE.

To confirm the diagnosis of PE, we need to visualize the pulmonary arteries directly. Doppler echocardiography is the best non-invasive test for detecting PE, as it can show the presence of emboli in the pulmonary arteries and assess the severity of right ventricular strain.

CT angiography (A) may be useful in some cases, such as when there are complications or when other imaging modalities are contraindicated. However, it is not typically used to diagnose PE directly.

High-resolution CT of the lung (C) can show pulmonary emboli and assess for complications, but it is not as sensitive as Doppler echocardiography in detecting PE.

Right-heart catheterization (D) is a invasive procedure that involves inserting a catheter into the right heart to measure pressures and assess the function of the right ventricle. While it can confirm the diagnosis of PE by showing evidence of right ventricular strain, it is not typically used as a first-line diagnostic test.

Therefore, Doppler echocardiography (B) is the most appropriate choice for confirming the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in this patient.
