## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient is a 2-month-old infant who has been exclusively breastfed and weighs 5,200 g (11 lb 8 oz). At this age, infants typically begin to show certain physical and cognitive milestones.

Firstly, let's consider the options provided:

A. Absence of asymmetric tonic neck reflex - This reflex is usually absent in infants until around 6-7 months of age. Since the patient is only 2 months old, it is unlikely that she has already developed this reflex.

B. Monosyllabic babble - Infants typically start babbling with consonant-vowel combinations (e.g., "ba," "da") by around 4-5 months and may begin to use single syllables like "mama" or "dada" by around 6-7 months. This option is plausible, but we need more information about the patient's vocal development.

C. Smiles in response to face - Infants typically smile in response to their mother's face when they are around 2-3 months old. This is a classic sign of social and emotional development. Given that the patient appears well and has been exclusively breastfed, it is likely that she has already developed this skill.

D. Stares at own hand - Infants typically stare at their hands or fingers when they are around 4-6 months old. While some infants may start to show interest in their hands earlier than others, staring at one's own hand is not a typical milestone for most infants until later in the first year.

Considering these options and the patient's age and feeding history, it is most likely that she has already developed the skill of smiling in response to her face. This is an important social and emotional milestone that indicates normal development.

Therefore, the answer is C. Smiles in response to face.
