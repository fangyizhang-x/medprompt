## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history of similar episodes of yellowish discoloration since liver transplantation and laboratory findings such as significantly reduced blood flow into the transplanted liver (indicated by Doppler ultrasound), it is reasonable to suspect that the patient may be experiencing a complication related to the graft, specifically an obliterative arteritis.

Obliterative arteritis is a known complication of liver transplantation, characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of small arteries within the graft. This condition can lead to reduced blood flow into the graft, as seen in this case. The biopsy of the transplanted liver would likely show evidence of this inflammatory process, including interstitial cellular infiltration with parenchymal fibrosis.

The other options are less likely:

A. Normal architecture of bile ducts and hepatocytes is not consistent with obliterative arteritis, which typically involves inflammation and fibrosis rather than normal tissue architecture.

B. Broad fibrous septations with formation of micronodules might be seen in conditions such as cirrhosis or portal hypertension, but are less likely to be the primary finding in an obliterative arteritis.

C. Ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes is more commonly associated with viral hepatitis or other forms of liver injury rather than obliterative arteritis.

D. Interstitial cellular infiltration with parenchymal fibrosis and obliterative arteritis are both consistent with the diagnosis of obliterative arteritis, which can be a complication of liver transplantation.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely histological feature to be seen in a biopsy of the transplanted liver is interstitial cellular infiltration with parenchymal fibrosis, obliterative arteritis.
