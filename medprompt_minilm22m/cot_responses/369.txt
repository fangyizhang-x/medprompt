## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Step 1: Assessing the patient's symptoms and medical history
The patient presents with syncope, dyspnea, palpitations, and a recent episode of flu-like illness. The recent hiking trip in Upstate New York could be relevant due to potential exposure to tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease or Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

### Step 2: Evaluating the ECG findings
The resting ECG shows no specific abnormalities that would point towards a particular diagnosis, but it is not described. However, given the patient's symptoms and recent travel history, one might consider conditions like arrhythmias or myocarditis.

### Step 3: Considering the serological testing results
Two-step serological testing confirms the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Lyme disease can cause a wide range of symptoms, including cardiac manifestations such as atrioventricular block (AV block) and cardiomyopathy.

### Step 4: Assessing the treatment options for Lyme disease
Treatment for Lyme disease typically involves antibiotics, with doxycycline being one of the recommended treatments. However, the patient's current condition requires immediate attention to prevent further cardiac complications.

### Step 5: Evaluating the treatment options
A. Intravenous ceftriaxone - This is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can be used for Lyme disease but may not address the underlying cause of the syncope and palpitations.
B. Oral doxycycline - This is the most appropriate initial treatment for Lyme disease, as it has been shown to effectively treat the infection and prevent long-term cardiac complications.
C. Atropine - This medication is used to treat bradycardia (slow heart rate) but does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.
D. Permanent pacemaker implantation - While this might be necessary in some cases, it is not a first-line treatment for Lyme disease and would likely be considered after other treatments have failed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{B}$
