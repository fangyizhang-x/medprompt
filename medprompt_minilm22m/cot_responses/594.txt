## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's analyze the key features presented in the newborn's physical examination and how they relate to potential cardiac anomalies.

1. **Sloping forehead, flat nasal bridge, increased interocular distance, low-set ears**: These findings are characteristic of Down syndrome (Trisomy 21). Individuals with Down syndrome often have a range of physical characteristics that can be detected at birth or shortly after.

2. **Protruding tongue and single palmar crease**: These features are also commonly associated with Down syndrome.

3. **Increased gap between the first and second toe**: This is another feature frequently seen in individuals with Down syndrome, known as polydactyly (extra fingers or toes).

4. **Distended abdomen**: This can be indicative of several conditions but, when combined with other findings, may suggest a gastrointestinal obstruction.

5. **X-ray showing two large air-filled spaces in the upper quadrant**: This finding is suggestive of duodenal atresia or stenosis, which are common congenital anomalies associated with Down syndrome.

6. **Small white and brown spots in the periphery of both irises**: These findings can be indicative of a condition known as oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1), but given the context of other physical features, it's more likely related to Down syndrome.

Considering these points, the cardiac anomaly most commonly associated with Down syndrome is **Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)**. ASDs are a leading cause of congenital heart disease in individuals with Down syndrome and can lead to pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and other complications if not treated promptly.

The other options:
- B. Atrioventricular septal defect: While this is a common cardiac anomaly, it's less specifically associated with Down syndrome compared to ASD.
- C. Tetralogy of Fallot: This congenital heart defect involves four components (Ventricular Septal Defect, Pulmonary Stenosis, Right Ventricular Hypertrophy, and Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection) that are not typically seen in individuals with Down syndrome.
- D. Ventricular septal defect: While a common cardiac anomaly, it's less specifically associated with Down syndrome compared to ASD.

Therefore, the answer is A.
