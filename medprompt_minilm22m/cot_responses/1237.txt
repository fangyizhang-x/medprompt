## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Firstly, let's consider the patient's situation. She is a 67-year-old woman who has been admitted to the hospital for two weeks after breaking her hip and is now recovering well. This indicates that she requires hospital care.

Secondly, we need to understand what Medicare Part A covers. Medicare Part A is primarily responsible for covering inpatient hospital stays, as well as some home health care services. However, it does not cover outpatient services such as lab tests or prescription drugs.

Given the patient's recent surgery and hospitalization, her primary concern should be covering the cost of her hospital stay. Since she has been admitted to the hospital for two weeks, inpatient hospital services would likely fall under Medicare Part A coverage.

Now, let's consider what Medicare Part B covers. Medicare Part B is primarily responsible for covering outpatient medical services such as doctor visits, lab tests, and prescription drugs. However, it does not cover inpatient hospital stays or surgery.

Considering the patient's recent surgery and hospitalization, her primary concern should be covering the cost of her hospital stay under Medicare Part A. Therefore, we can conclude that Medicare Part A will cover the majority of her hospital fees, including inpatient drugs and lab tests.

The best answer is A.
