Firstly, it is essential to prioritize the child's immediate safety due to his symptoms of widespread rash, diffuse hives, tongue edema, and low blood pressure. The presence of these signs suggests anaphylaxis, a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that requires prompt medical attention.

Given the situation, the most critical step is to ensure the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) are stable before attempting any further management. Since verbal communication with the parents is not possible due to their unavailability, we must rely on alternative methods to obtain consent.

Option A, continuing to call the parents and delaying intubation until verbal consent is obtained over the phone, is not advisable as it may delay necessary treatment and put the child at greater risk of anaphylaxis progression. The child's condition requires immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration.

Option B, administering epinephrine and sedating and intubating the patient, is also incorrect because it would exacerbate the situation by inducing respiratory depression and potentially causing cardiac arrest due to the low blood pressure.

Option C, obtaining written consent from the patientâ€™s teacher, is not sufficient as the teacher may not be aware of the child's medical history or the severity of his condition. Moreover, the teacher's presence does not guarantee that they will provide informed consent on behalf of the parents.

Option D, waiting for the parents to arrive and then proceeding with written consent before intubating, is the most appropriate course of action. This approach ensures that the patient receives immediate medical attention while also obtaining verbal consent from the parents or another authorized individual who can provide informed consent on their behalf. It allows for a more controlled environment and minimizes the risk of delaying necessary treatment.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.
