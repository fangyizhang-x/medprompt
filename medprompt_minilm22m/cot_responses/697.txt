Given the child's presentation with rapid breathing, unwell appearance, and physical examination findings such as liver enlargement, mild pitting edema, fixed split S2, and rales on auscultation, we can consider several potential diagnoses. However, considering the age of the child (3 years) and the specific physical examination findings, we should first rule out conditions that are more common in older children or adults.

1. **Liver enlargement**: This is a significant finding that could be indicative of liver disease, which could be due to various causes including congenital conditions, metabolic disorders, or acquired diseases such as viral hepatitis or biliary atresia.

2. **Mild pitting edema and fixed split S2**: These findings are suggestive of right-sided heart failure or a condition affecting the tricuspid valve. However, in the context of liver enlargement, it's essential to consider conditions that could lead to increased pressure in the hepatic veins or direct effects on the liver.

3. **Rales and decreased lung volumes**: These findings can be indicative of pulmonary congestion or fluid overload, which could be secondary to heart failure or other conditions affecting the right side of the heart.

4. **No family history of congenital disorders or metabolic syndromes**: This information is crucial as it helps to rule out genetic conditions that might predispose individuals to certain congenital heart defects.

Considering these points:

- **Atrial Septal Defect (B)**: While this condition can cause right-sided heart failure and pulmonary congestion, the absence of a family history of congenital disorders or metabolic syndromes makes it less likely in this case.

- **Patent Foramen Ovale (C)**: This is more commonly associated with conditions like patent ductus arteriosus or atrial septal defects that are typically diagnosed later in childhood.

- **Endocardial Cushion Syndrome (D)**: This condition can lead to congenital heart defects, including those affecting the tricuspid valve and right ventricle. However, it is less commonly associated with liver enlargement as a primary finding.

Given these considerations, the most likely diagnosis that ties together all the provided information is **Liver Failure (A)**. Liver failure could be due to various causes such as viral hepatitis, biliary atresia, or other metabolic disorders affecting the liver. The physical examination findings of liver enlargement and signs suggestive of right-sided heart failure are consistent with this
