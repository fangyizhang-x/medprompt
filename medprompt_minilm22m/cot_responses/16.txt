## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of urinary frequency, post-void dribbling, and difficulty initiating a stream of urine, along with his enlarged prostate on digital rectal exam, the most likely diagnosis is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is a common condition in older men that can cause urinary symptoms due to obstruction of the urethra.

To manage this patient's symptoms, we need to consider medications that can help relax the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, improve urine flow, and reduce post-void dribbling. Let's evaluate the options:

A. Hydrochlorothiazide - This is a diuretic that may help with urinary frequency by increasing urine production, but it does not address the underlying obstruction or smooth muscle relaxation.

B. Midodrine - This is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist that can cause vasodilation and increase blood flow to the prostate, which may help alleviate symptoms of BPH. However, its primary use is for symptomatic relief in patients with severe hypertension, not specifically for urinary frequency or post-void dribbling.

C. Oxybutynin - This is an anticholinergic medication that can help relax the bladder muscle and improve urine flow. It may also provide some relief from post-void dribbling due to its ability to reduce bladder neck spasms. However, it's not typically used as a first-line treatment for BPH.

D. Tamsulosin - This is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist that specifically targets the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, relaxing them and improving urine flow. It's commonly used to treat symptoms of BPH, including urinary frequency, post-void dribbling, and difficulty initiating a stream of urine.

Considering the patient's symptoms and medical history, Tamsulosin is the most appropriate medication for this patient due to its specific mechanism of action in relaxing prostate smooth muscle and improving urine flow.

The final answer is: D
