## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's age, symptoms, and physical examination findings, let's analyze each option step by step:

A. Endometrial polyp: While endometrial polyps can cause irregular menstrual bleeding, they are more commonly associated with postmenopausal bleeding or menorrhagia rather than oligomenorrhea (infrequent periods). Additionally, the patient is not postmenopausal.

B. Inadequate gonadotropin production: This option is less likely because the patient's last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago, which suggests that her ovaries are still producing hormones in sufficient quantities to maintain regular menstruation. Inadequate gonadotropin production would more likely result in amenorrhea (absence of menstruation).

C. Defective von Willebrand factor: Von Willebrand disease is a genetic disorder that affects blood clotting and can lead to excessive bleeding, including menstrual bleeding. However, it typically presents with mucocutaneous bleeding rather than oligomenorrhea.

D. Excessive androgen production: Androgen excess can cause irregular menstrual cycles, but it's less likely in this case given the patient's age and lack of family or personal history of serious illness. Additionally, excessive androgen production would more likely result in hirsutism (excess hair growth) rather than oligomenorrhea.

Considering these factors, the most plausible explanation for the patient's symptoms is inadequate gonadotropin production, which can lead to irregular menstrual cycles and oligomenorrhea.

The final answer is: B
