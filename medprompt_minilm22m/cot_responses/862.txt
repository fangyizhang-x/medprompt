The clinical presentation of this 10-month-old infant is highly suggestive of intussusception, a condition where one part of the intestine slides into another, leading to bowel obstruction and potentially severe complications if not treated promptly.

1. **Vomiting and abdominal mass**: The patient's vomiting and presence of an abdominal mass are classic signs of intestinal obstruction. The fact that the most recent vomit was green further supports this diagnosis, as it suggests blood or bile in the vomit, which can be a sign of intussusception.
2. **Irritability and crying**: These symptoms can be associated with pain, which is a common complaint in patients with intussusception.
3. **Palpation in the periumbilical region**: The presence of an abdominal mass in this area is highly suggestive of intussusception.

The emergency laparotomy performed shows a part of the intestine folded into the section adjacent to it, which is consistent with intussusception. This finding supports the diagnosis and explains why surgical intervention was necessary.

In contrast, Meckelâ€™s diverticulum (A) typically presents with gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction due to ectopic gastric mucosa, but it does not usually cause an abdominal mass or fold of intestine into another section. Duodenal atresia (B) is a congenital condition that causes intestinal obstruction and vomiting, but it would more likely present with bilious vomiting rather than green vomit. Pyloric stenosis (C) typically presents in infants around 3-4 weeks old with non-bilious projectile vomiting, which does not match this patient's presentation.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is intussusception.
