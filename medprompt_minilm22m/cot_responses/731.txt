To answer this question, let's consider the development and anatomy of the kidney.

1. **Understanding the context**: The infant died due to severe respiratory distress, which suggests a problem with the kidneys' ability to concentrate urine or manage fluid balance.
2. **Identifying key structures involved in kidney development**:
   - **Mesonephros (A)**: This is an intermediate stage of kidney development that typically disappears before birth. It's not directly responsible for the formation of the collecting ducts.
   - **Paramesonephric duct (B)**: Also known as the MÃ¼llerian duct, this structure primarily gives rise to the female reproductive system and some parts of the urinary system, but it's not involved in kidney development.
   - **Metanephric mesenchyme (C)**: This is a critical component in the formation of the nephrons, which are the functional units of the kidneys. The metanephric mesenchyme gives rise to the renal tubules and collecting ducts.
   - **Ureteric bud (D)**: This structure plays a crucial role in the development of the collecting ducts by forming the ureters and then branching into the collecting ducts, which eventually form the nephrons.

Given that the left kidney is selectively lacking cortical and medullary collecting ducts, it suggests an issue with the formation or development of these structures. The **ureteric bud** is directly involved in this process as it gives rise to the collecting ducts within the kidneys.

Therefore, considering the developmental origin of the renal collecting ducts, the answer is:

## Answer
(D) Ureteric bud
