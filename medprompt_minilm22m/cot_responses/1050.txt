## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The wobble phenomenon explains that a single codon can code for more than one amino acid due to the flexibility in the third position (the "wobble" position) of the codon. This means that even though the first two positions are fixed, the third position can vary.

In the case of leucine, we know that CUU is a codon that codes for it. Now, let's consider each option:

A. AUG - This is the start codon (initiation codon), which codes for methionine, not leucine.
B. CCC - This is another codon that codes for proline, not leucine.
C. CCA - Similarly, this is a codon that codes for proline, not leucine.
D. CUA - The wobble phenomenon allows for the possibility of a different third nucleotide (in this case, U) to code for leucine.

Therefore, based on the wobble phenomenon and the fact that CUU codes for leucine, we can conclude that CUA is another codon that codes for leucine.
