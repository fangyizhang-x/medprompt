## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of gradually worsening right arm weakness, difficulty walking, and specific physical examination findings such as 4/5 strength in right shoulder abduction and right arm flexion, tremor in the right hand, and tongue fasciculations, we can deduce that this patient is likely experiencing a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD).

The presence of muscle weakness, particularly in the right arm, suggests involvement of the motor neurons. The fact that strength is 5/5 throughout the left upper extremity indicates that the left side is spared from significant weakness, which is consistent with the typical asymmetric presentation of PD.

The physical examination findings also support this diagnosis, including the presence of a tremor in the right hand and tongue fasciculations, both of which are characteristic features of PD. The absence of sensory symptoms (sensation to touch and vibration is intact) further supports this diagnosis.

Considering the treatment options provided:

A. Natalizumab - This is an immunomodulatory medication used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, not Parkinson's disease.

B. Selegiline - This is a monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor that is commonly used as a first-line treatment for Parkinson's disease, along with levodopa/carbidopa.

C. Bromocriptine - This is a dopamine agonist that can be used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, particularly in patients who do not respond to levodopa/carbidopa alone.

D. Riluzole - This is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have neuroprotective effects and is sometimes used off-label for the treatment of PD, but it is not a first-line treatment due to its side effect profile and limited efficacy.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient with Parkinson's disease would be selegiline, as it is commonly used in conjunction with levodopa/carbidopa and has been shown to improve motor symptoms in patients with PD.
