Given the patient's presentation of bright red blood in the stool without pain or fever, a diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) is highly likely. The presence of an obese abdomen without tenderness to palpation suggests that the cause may not be related to an acute abdominal condition such as appendicitis or diverticulitis.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes and fibromyalgia, which can increase the risk for GI bleeding due to impaired blood clotting and increased mucosal sensitivity. The presence of schizotypal personality disorder is also relevant, as individuals with this disorder are at an increased risk for psychiatric comorbidities that may contribute to GI bleeding.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate initial treatment would be to provide IV fluids and NPO (nil per os) to manage the patient's hydration status and prevent further blood loss. This approach is supported by guidelines that recommend fluid resuscitation in patients with GI bleeding to maintain adequate blood volume and prevent hypovolemic shock.

Cautery of an arteriovenous malformation (A) may be considered if there are other causes for GI bleeding that have been ruled out, such as a bleeding peptic ulcer or variceal hemorrhage. However, this is not the most appropriate initial treatment in this case.

NPO, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole (C) would be an inappropriate treatment approach for GI bleeding. Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that may not be necessary for this patient's condition, and metronidazole is typically used to treat infections such as giardiasis or amoebiasis.

Surgical excision of poorly differentiated tissue (D) would be an overly aggressive approach for GI bleeding without other causes identified. The patient's presentation does not suggest a need for surgical intervention at this time.

Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition is IV fluids and NPO to manage his hydration status and prevent further blood loss.
