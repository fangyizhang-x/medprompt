(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, which includes a painful mass on her neck that has grown over the last few days, tender and relatively soft and mobile skin with small healing skin punctures in the area where she was bitten by her neighborâ€™s kitten 3 weeks ago, and several discolored teeth, the most likely diagnosis is cat-scratch disease (CSD), caused by Bartonella henselae.

The presence of a painful mass on the neck, particularly when accompanied by tender and mobile skin with small healing punctures, is highly suggestive of CSD. The fact that she has no history of serious illness or medications that could be contributing to her symptoms further supports this diagnosis.

Histologic evaluation for Reed-Sternburg cells (B) would be more appropriate if the suspicion was higher for a different condition, such as lymphoma or histiocytosis. Toxoplasma IgG using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (C) might be considered if there were concerns about toxoplasmosis, but this is less likely given her presentation and lack of other symptoms.

Culture for facultative anaerobes (A) would not be the most appropriate initial diagnostic study in this case. While Bartonella henselae can be cultured from skin lesions, it is typically done after a diagnosis has been made based on clinical presentation and histopathological examination.

Warthin-Starry silver stain for Bartonella henselae (D) is the most appropriate diagnostic study at this time. This staining technique is specifically used to detect the presence of Bartonella henselae in skin lesions, which would support a diagnosis of cat-scratch disease.

Therefore, based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, the most appropriate initial diagnostic study would be Warthin-Starry silver stain for Bartonella henselae.
