## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 12-month-old boy, we can deduce several key points:

1. **Past medical history**: The patient had a pyloric myomectomy at 2 months of age due to projectile vomiting, which suggests a possible gastrointestinal issue.
2. **Current symptoms and signs**: The presence of slight tachycardia, pallor, and a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur in the left upper sternal border are indicative of cardiac issues.
3. **Developmental milestones**: The patient has reached all appropriate developmental milestones, which suggests that any current issue is not related to developmental delays.

Considering these points, we can infer that the cardiac issue might be related to the previous surgical intervention or another underlying condition.

**Option analysis:**

A. **Decreased vitamin B12 levels**: While vitamin B12 deficiency can cause pallor and anemia, it is less likely given the patient's age (12 months) and the presence of a systolic ejection murmur, which might suggest a more complex cardiac issue.

B. **Increased Hb S levels**: This option is highly unlikely as the patient has reached all appropriate developmental milestones, indicating that his hemoglobin level should be within normal limits for his age.

C. **Decreased hemoglobin**: Given the presence of a systolic ejection murmur and slight pallor, it is plausible that the patient's hemoglobin level could be decreased due to anemia or another underlying condition affecting red blood cell production or destruction.

D. **Metabolic alkalosis**: While metabolic alkalosis can occur in various conditions, including gastrointestinal issues or cardiac problems, it is not directly related to the current clinical presentation of a systolic ejection murmur and pallor.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the patient's symptoms and signs, the most likely expected laboratory result would be decreased hemoglobin levels due to anemia or another underlying condition affecting red blood cell production or destruction. This could be related to the previous surgical intervention or another cardiac issue.

The final answer is:
