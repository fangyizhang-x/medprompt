## Step 1: Analyze the symptoms described in the scenario.
The patient exhibits several behaviors that are characteristic of specific psychiatric conditions, including yelling at her mother, scoffing at criticism, and displaying a lack of empathy towards others.

## Step 2: Consider the impact on relationships and daily functioning.
The patient's behavior is disruptive to her home life (yelling at her mother) and affects her academic performance (lackluster grades). This suggests that the issue may not be purely related to normal adolescent development or peer pressure.

## Step 3: Evaluate the presence of other symptoms.
The patient denies experiencing physical abuse, having a sexual partner, or smoking cigarettes. However, she does express a preference for learning through online videos and scoffs at criticism from others, which could indicate a lack of empathy or impulsivity.

## Step 4: Assess the severity of the behavior.
While the patient's behavior is concerning, it does not appear to be severe enough to meet the criteria for conduct disorder (C), as there are no reports of aggressive or violent behavior. Similarly, antisocial personality disorder (D) typically involves a long-standing pattern of disregard for others' rights and feelings.

## Step 5: Consider oppositional defiant disorder (ODD).
Oppositional defiant disorder is characterized by a pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness. The patient's behavior fits this description, as she yells at her mother, scoffs at criticism, and displays a lack of empathy.

## Step 6: Evaluate the likelihood of normal behavior (B).
Normal behavior typically involves functioning well academically, maintaining healthy relationships with family members, and avoiding substance abuse or other negative behaviors. The patient's grades are affected, but she does not exhibit these characteristics.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$
