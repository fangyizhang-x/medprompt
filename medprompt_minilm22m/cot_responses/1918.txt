To determine which option is most likely to increase the negative predictive value (NPV) for this new HIV screening test, let's analyze each option step by step:

A. **Increased prevalence of HIV in the tested population**: If there was an increased prevalence of HIV among those who received a positive test result compared to those who received a negative test result, it would mean that more actual positives were being incorrectly identified as negatives due to false negatives. This scenario actually decreases NPV because it increases the likelihood of false negatives.

B. **Decreased prevalence of HIV in the tested population**: If there was a decrease in the overall prevalence of HIV among those who received a negative test result compared to those who received a positive test result, it would mean that more actual negatives were being correctly identified as negatives due to true negatives remaining high. This scenario actually increases NPV because it decreases the likelihood of false positives.

C. **Increased number of false positive test results**: An increased number of false positive test results would decrease NPV because it means more actual negatives are incorrectly identified as positives, leading to a higher rate of false positives among those who received negative test results.

D. **Increased number of false negative test results**: This option is the opposite of what we're looking for in terms of increasing NPV. An increased number of false negative test results would decrease NPV because it means more actual negatives are incorrectly identified as negatives, leading to a higher rate of false negatives among those who received negative test results.

Therefore, the most likely factor to increase the negative predictive value for this test is a **decrease in prevalence of HIV in the tested population** (Option B). This would lead to fewer actual positives being incorrectly identified as negatives due to true negatives remaining high.
