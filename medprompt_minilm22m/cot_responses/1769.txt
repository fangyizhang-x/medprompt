(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of a 4-day-old newborn with a generalized erythematous maculopapular rash and pustules sparing the palms and soles, we can consider several potential diagnoses.

Firstly, the fact that the mother has gonorrhea treated 4 years ago is an important consideration. Gonococcal infections are known to cause congenital syphilis in newborns if the infection occurs during pregnancy or within 90 days of delivery.

The physical examination findings of a rash with pustules and sparing of the palms and soles are classic for congenital syphilis, particularly the "chickenpox" variant. This condition is characterized by a maculopapular rash that typically appears in the first few weeks of life, followed by the development of pustules.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:

- Acropustulosis (A) is a form of erythema multiforme that presents with small, pus-filled blisters on the skin. It is not consistent with this clinical presentation.
- Erythema toxicum (B) is a common skin rash in newborns, but it typically appears within 24 hours to 2 weeks after birth and does not usually involve pustules or have a characteristic "chickenpox" appearance.
- Pustular melanosis (C) is a rare condition characterized by the presence of pustules on the skin. However, it is not consistent with this clinical presentation.

Given these considerations, the most likely diagnosis for this 4-day-old newborn is congenital syphilis, particularly the "chickenpox" variant caused by gonococcal infection.

Therefore, the answer is D.
