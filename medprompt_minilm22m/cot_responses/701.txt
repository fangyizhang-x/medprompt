## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Firstly, let's consider the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings to narrow down the possible diagnoses.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with headache, fatigue, muscle weakness, frequent urination, tetany, mild abdominal distension, reduced bowel sounds, and hypertensive retinal changes. These symptoms are suggestive of a hormonal imbalance, particularly related to electrolyte disturbances and possibly an adrenal issue given the location of the mass.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: Tetany (muscle cramps or spasms) can be associated with low calcium levels (hypocalcemia), which is often seen in conditions affecting parathyroid glands or other endocrine systems. The presence of hypertensive retinal changes could indicate a condition that affects blood pressure regulation, such as pheochromocytoma.

3. **Imaging Findings**: An adrenal adenoma is confirmed by the CT scan showing an 8 cm unilateral left adrenal mass. Adrenal adenomas are benign tumors of the adrenal gland and can cause hormonal imbalances leading to symptoms like those described in this patient.

4. **Laboratory Findings Based on Likely Diagnosis**:
   - Given the suspected diagnosis of an adrenal adenoma, we would expect to see elevated levels of aldosterone (a hormone produced by the adrenal cortex), which is a key component of the body's response to low blood volume and high blood pressure.
   - Aldosterone causes sodium retention, leading to increased sodium levels in the blood (hypernatremia) and water retention, causing an increase in blood volume. This can lead to hypertension.
   - The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is activated, which increases aldosterone production further, contributing to the observed hypertension.

Considering these points:

- **Option A (Metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, hyperkalemia)**: Incorrect because metabolic acidosis would not be expected in this scenario given the elevated aldosterone levels.
  
- **Option B (Metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia)**: Incorrect for similar reasons as option A; metabolic acidosis is not consistent with the expected hormonal effects of an adrenal adenoma.

- **Option C (Metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, hypokalemia)**: This option aligns well with the expected hormonal imbalances caused by an adrenal adenoma. The elevated aldosterone levels would lead
