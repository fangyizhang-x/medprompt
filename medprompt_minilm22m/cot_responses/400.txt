## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, including breathlessness, swelling of the tongue and lips, skin rash on the back and abdomen, elevated blood pressure, tachypnea, and mild lip and tongue edema, we can consider potential side effects of medications that are commonly used in heart failure management.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option:

A. Captopril - This is an ACE inhibitor, which is a class of drugs commonly used to treat hypertension and heart failure. One of the well-known side effects of ACE inhibitors is cough, which can be severe and may lead to respiratory distress. Given that the patient developed breathlessness shortly after starting captopril, this could be a contributing factor.

B. Amlodipine - This is a calcium channel blocker used primarily for hypertension and angina. While it can cause peripheral edema, it's less likely to cause severe respiratory symptoms like cough or significant lip and tongue swelling compared to ACE inhibitors.

C. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) - This is a diuretic that can be used in the treatment of heart failure but is not typically associated with the specific side effects described here.

D. Propranolol - This is a beta-blocker, which can be used for hypertension and certain types of heart failure. While it can cause peripheral edema, it's less likely to cause severe respiratory symptoms like cough or significant lip and tongue swelling compared to ACE inhibitors.

Considering the patient's symptoms and the medications listed, the most likely culprit is an ACE inhibitor due to its association with cough as a side effect.

The final answer is: A
