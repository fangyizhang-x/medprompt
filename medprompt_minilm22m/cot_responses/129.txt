## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the scenario, let's break down the key points:

1. **Patient presentation**: The patient is a 17-year-old woman who has collapsed in her bedroom, indicating potential cardiac or respiratory distress.
2. **Vital signs**: The patient shows tachycardia (elevated heart rate), hypertension, and widened QRS complexes on ECG, which are indicative of a possible cardiac issue.
3. **Physical examination findings**: Dry oral mucosa and tongue, palpable bladder, and unresponsiveness to stimuli suggest dehydration and possibly hypovolemia or shock.

Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is a drug overdose, specifically clomipramine, given its use for treating depression. The widened QRS complexes on ECG are consistent with cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

Given the options:

A. **Sodium bicarbonate**: While it may help in certain cases of acidosis or alkalosis, it's not the first-line treatment for a suspected drug overdose and might even worsen the situation by increasing potassium levels.

B. **Induced vomiting**: This is generally contraindicated in acute poisoning situations due to the risk of aspiration and worsening of the condition.

C. **Norepinephrine**: This medication is used to treat severe hypotension (low blood pressure) or shock, which could be a consequence of cardiac arrest or other severe complications arising from the overdose. It's a more appropriate choice for managing potential hypovolemic shock in this scenario.

D. **Diazepam**: While it can help with sedation and muscle relaxation, it is not the primary treatment for suspected drug overdose or cardiac arrhythmias.

Therefore, considering the need to address potential hypotension and support cardiac function, the best course of treatment would be to administer norepinephrine to manage shock and prevent further complications.
