## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, we can start by considering the key elements of his history and physical exam findings.

1. **History of IV drug abuse**: This increases the risk for infections, including abscesses or septicemia.
2. **Multiple admissions for septic shock**: This suggests a high level of severity and potential for ongoing infection or inflammation.
3. **Fever and worsening abdominal pain over the past week**: These symptoms are concerning for an acute abdomen or an infectious process.
4. **Physical exam findings**:
   - A murmur over the left upper sternal border is suggestive of cardiac involvement, which could be related to septic shock or another underlying condition.
   - Left upper quadrant tenderness on abdominal exam is consistent with liver or spleen pathology.

Considering these points:

- **Diverticulitis (A)**: While diverticulitis can cause abdominal pain and fever, it typically presents with more localized symptoms such as left lower quadrant pain rather than left upper quadrant tenderness.
- **Hepatic abscess (B)**: This is a possibility given the patient's history of IV drug abuse and multiple admissions for septic shock. Hepatic abscesses can cause fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice, but they are less likely to present with a murmur over the left upper sternal border.
- **Mesenteric ischemia (C)**: This condition is characterized by reduced blood flow to the intestines, which can lead to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and potentially life-threatening complications. However, it typically presents with more diffuse abdominal pain rather than localized tenderness or a specific murmur.
- **Splenic abscess (D)**: Given the patient's history of IV drug abuse and multiple admissions for septic shock, splenic involvement is highly plausible. Splenic abscesses can cause fever, abdominal pain, and a palpable spleen on physical exam. The presence of a murmur over the left upper sternal border could be related to cardiac involvement or another underlying condition.

Considering these factors, the most likely diagnosis is **D. Splenic abscess**, as it aligns with the patient's history of IV drug abuse, multiple admissions for septic shock, and physical exam findings suggestive of splenic pathology.

Therefore, the answer is D.
