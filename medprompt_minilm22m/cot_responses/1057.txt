## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine the factor by which the flow of blood has been decreased in a peripheral artery with stenosis, we need to understand the relationship between stenosis and blood flow.

When an artery is stenosed, it means that there is a narrowing or blockage of the lumen (the inside space) of the artery. This narrowing reduces the cross-sectional area available for blood flow.

To calculate the factor by which the flow has been decreased, we can use the formula:

Flow Decrease = Stenosis / Normal Flow

Given that the stenosis is 50% and assuming normal flow is 100%, we can plug in the values:

Flow Decrease = 0.5 (50%) / 1 (100%)
Flow Decrease = 0.5
Flow Decrease = 50%

Therefore, the factor by which the flow of blood has been decreased is 50%.

The answer is D.
