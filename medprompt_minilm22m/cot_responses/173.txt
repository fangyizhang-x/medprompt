## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, including facial swelling, dark urine (indicative of hematuria), sore throat, and mild periorbital and pedal edema, along with a urinalysis showing 12-15 RBC/hpf, 2-5 WBC/hpf, and 30 mg/dL protein, the most likely diagnosis is nephritic syndrome. The presence of hematuria (blood in the urine) and proteinuria (protein in the urine) suggests kidney damage or disease.

The patient's recent sore throat could be related to a viral infection, but given his overall presentation, it's less likely to be the primary cause. The mild edema (swelling) is also consistent with nephritic syndrome.

Considering the options provided for additional findings on urinalysis:

A. WBC casts - These are indicative of glomerulonephritis, which could be a complication of nephritic syndrome due to inflammation in the kidneys. However, they would typically be seen in conjunction with other specific types of kidney damage (e.g., acute glomerular injury).

B. Granular casts - These are also associated with glomerulonephritis and would support the diagnosis of an inflammatory process affecting the kidneys.

C. Hyaline casts - While these can be found in various conditions, including nephrotic syndrome due to heavy proteinuria, they are not specific for nephritic syndrome or glomerulonephritis.

D. RBC casts - These are indicative of glomerular damage and would support the diagnosis of an inflammatory process affecting the kidneys, such as nephritic syndrome.

Given the patient's presentation and the options provided, the most likely additional finding on urinalysis that would confirm a diagnosis of nephritic syndrome is granular casts (B), which are associated with inflammation in the kidneys.
