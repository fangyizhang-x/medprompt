## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of excessive thirst, excessive urination, weight loss, and laboratory results indicating hyperglycemia (elevated blood sugar) with undetectable C-peptide levels, this patient is likely experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious complication of diabetes mellitus. The absence of C-peptide in the serum further supports this diagnosis.

The best initial therapy for DKA should aim at correcting dehydration and electrolyte imbalances while also addressing the hyperglycemia.

## Step 1: Identify the primary goal of treatment
The primary objective is to correct dehydration, which can be achieved through intravenous fluids. This helps in reducing the osmotic load on the kidneys, thereby facilitating the excretion of excess glucose.

## Step 2: Consider the need for insulin correction
In DKA, the body produces excessive amounts of glucagon due to the lack of insulin, leading to hyperglycemia. Insulin therapy is essential to reduce blood sugar levels and counteract the effects of glucagon.

## Step 3: Evaluate the options based on their suitability for initial treatment
- A. Metformin is a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes but is not effective in treating DKA.
- B. Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea used to stimulate insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells, which is not appropriate as an initial therapy for DKA due to its potential to cause hypoglycemia.
- C. Intravenous fluids, insulin infusion, and correction of electrolytes are the most appropriate choices for initial treatment of DKA. This combination addresses dehydration, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances simultaneously.
- D. Basal-bolus insulin is typically used in the management of type 1 diabetes or as an adjunct to oral medications in type 2 diabetes but is not the best initial therapy for DKA.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
