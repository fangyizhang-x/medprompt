## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, we can start by considering the key elements of his history and physical examination findings.

Firstly, the patient reports acute onset of left lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and has had two maroon-colored bowel movements since the pain started. These symptoms are classic for a gastrointestinal bleed, particularly in the context of diverticular disease and multiple sessile polyps which can cause bleeding.

The patient's past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. While these conditions may contribute to his overall risk profile, they do not directly explain the acute abdominal pain or the specific symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current medications include lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor), hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic), atorvastatin (a statin), dabigatran (an anticoagulant), methotrexate (an immunosuppressant), and he admits to missing some of his medications recently. While this is concerning, it does not directly relate to the patient's current symptoms.

The patient's physical examination findings are also critical. He has notable abdominal distention and tenderness to palpation in all four abdominal quadrants, which suggests a significant source of pain or bleeding. The absence of bowel sounds further supports the presence of an intestinal issue.

Considering these factors, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. Cardiac thromboembolism - This is unlikely as there are no specific symptoms or signs that would suggest cardiac involvement in this patient's presentation.

B. Duodenal compression - While possible, duodenal compression is less likely given the patient's history of diverticular disease and multiple sessile polyps which can cause bleeding.

C. Perforated intestinal mucosal herniation - This is a possibility but not as directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings compared to other options.

D. Paradoxical thromboembolism - This option is the most likely explanation for this patient's condition. The paradoxical embolism refers to an embolus that travels from a venous source (e.g., heart) to an arterial destination (e.g., bowel), causing a paradoxical embolic phenomenon. Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to clot formation in the left atrium and subsequently embolize
