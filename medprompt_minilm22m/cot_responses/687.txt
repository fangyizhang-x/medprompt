(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The chronic cough in a 12-year-old boy with no history of respiratory or neurological disorders, and who exhibits specific behaviors such as eye blinking, coughing, and grunting that disappear for a few weeks without explanation, suggests a condition known as "coughing fits" or "coughing spells." These episodes are often associated with stress, fatigue, or other emotional states.

Given the symptoms described, the most likely diagnosis is **Coughing Fits** or **Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy**, where a caregiver induces coughing fits in a child to gain attention and sympathy. However, considering the absence of any neurological or respiratory disorders, it's more likely that this is a case of **Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another**.

The key to managing Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another (FDIA) is to address the underlying psychological issues driving the behavior. The child in question exhibits eye blinking, coughing, and grunting behaviors that disappear for a few weeks without explanation, which are classic symptoms of FDIA.

To control this patient's symptoms, we need to address the underlying psychological factors contributing to his behavior. **Atomoxetine** is an antidepressant medication that can help reduce stress and anxiety in children, which may contribute to the development of Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another. It has a strong evidence base for its effectiveness in reducing symptoms of FDIA.

In contrast, **Clonidine**, **Haloperidol**, and **Levetiracetam** are not typically used as first-line treatments for Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another or coughing fits.

Therefore, the most effective drug to control this patient's symptoms is likely to be **Atomoxetine**.
