## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)
Therefore, the answer is B.
Explanation:
The scenario described in the question involves a man who has experienced a significant loss (the blow to his testes) and is now feeling diminished or less capable. In response, he jokes about being half the man that she once knew, implying that he feels inadequate or diminished by his new circumstances. This reaction is an example of an ego defense mechanism known as "deflection," where the individual redirects attention away from their feelings of inadequacy and towards something more positive (in this case, the wife's former beauty). The other options do not involve a similar ego defense mechanism: A involves a religious person speaking out against a social issue; C involves an aggressive behavior to deal with anger; D involves a man expressing frustration about being left alone. 

The best answer is B
