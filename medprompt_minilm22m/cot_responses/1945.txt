(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation and progression of symptoms, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Initial Presentation**: The boy initially presented with sore throat but was found to have a negative strep test. This suggests that his condition is not related to streptococcal pharyngitis.

2. **Refusal of Antibiotics**: His pediatrician refused to prescribe antibiotics, which led the father to start him on penicillin. While this might seem like an attempt to treat a bacterial infection, it's essential to consider other possibilities given the subsequent development of symptoms.

3. **Development of Fever and Rash**: The boy developed a fever and a rash shortly after starting penicillin. This timing suggests that the antibiotic is likely causing the rash.

4. **Nikolsky's Sign Positive**: A positive Nikolsky's sign indicates that there is an increased permeability of the skin, allowing fluid to escape into the tissue layer. This is characteristic of certain autoimmune blistering diseases.

5. **Worsening Symptoms and Skin Sloughing**: The boy's symptoms worsened, with sloughing of skin covering over 30% of his body, oropharynx involvement, corneal membranes affected, and a positive Nikolsky's sign. These findings are highly suggestive of a severe autoimmune blistering disease.

Considering these points:

- **Erythema Multiforme (A)** is an immune-mediated condition that typically presents with mucosal lesions and can be triggered by infections or medications. While it could explain some symptoms, the presence of a positive Nikolsky's sign and widespread skin involvement make this less likely.
  
- **Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (B)** is a severe skin condition usually caused by medications, often leading to widespread skin necrosis. However, the initial sore throat and negative strep test do not strongly support this diagnosis.

- **Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (C)** is a tick-borne illness that can cause rash but typically does not involve such extensive skin sloughing or mucosal involvement as seen in this case.

- **Pemphigus Vulgaris (D)** is an autoimmune disease characterized by blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. The positive Nikolsky's sign, widespread skin involvement, fever, rash progression, and specific symptoms such as oropharynx and corneal membrane involvement make this
