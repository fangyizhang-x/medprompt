## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings (purple rash on cheeks and nose), chest x-ray results (bilateral hilar adenopathy and calcified nodule in the left lower lobe), bronchoalveolar lavage results (CD4:CD8 T-lymphocyte ratio of 10:1), and biopsy result (noncaseating granuloma), we can deduce that this patient likely has sarcoidosis.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease that can affect any organ, but it most commonly affects the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes, and liver. The presence of a noncaseating granuloma in the biopsy sample is particularly characteristic of sarcoidosis.

Now, considering the patient's demographic information (African American woman), we need to identify the strongest predisposing factor for the development of this condition.

Race (Option A) is indeed a significant predisposing factor for sarcoidosis. Studies have shown that African Americans are more likely to develop active sarcoidosis than individuals of other racial backgrounds, with a prevalence ratio of approximately 2-3:1 [1]. This increased risk is thought to be due to genetic and environmental factors.

While exposure to beryllium (Option B) can cause granulomatous disease, it is not considered a primary predisposing factor for sarcoidosis. Beryllium exposure is more commonly associated with lung diseases such as chronic beryllium disease [2].

Alcohol consumption (Option C) may contribute to the development of various respiratory conditions, but there is no established link between alcoholism and an increased risk of developing sarcoidosis.

Smoking (Option D) can exacerbate respiratory symptoms in patients with existing lung disease, including sarcoidosis. However, smoking is not considered a primary predisposing factor for the development of sarcoidosis itself.

Therefore, based on the patient's clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and biopsy results, the strongest predisposing factor for the development of this patient's condition is her race (African American).
