## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Step 1: Initial Assessment and Diagnosis
The patient presents with fever, abdominal pain, nausea, generalized abdominal tenderness, rebound guarding, and decreased bowel sounds, which are indicative of peritonitis. The emergency exploratory laparoscopy confirms a perforated appendix with an adjacent abscess and peritoneal inflammation.

### Step 2: Understanding the Microbiological Findings
The cultures from the abscess fluid grow catalase-producing, anaerobic, gram-negative rods that have the ability to grow in bile. This description is characteristic of Enterobacteriaceae, specifically Pseudomonas aeruginosa or possibly other gram-negative rods such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, but given the context and growth characteristics, it's more likely to be a catalase-positive, anaerobic bacterium.

### Step 3: Choosing Appropriate Antibiotics
Given the bacteria identified (catalase-positive, anaerobic, gram-negative rods) and their ability to grow in bile, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would target these organisms effectively. The key is finding an antibiotic that covers both aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative coverage.

### Step 4: Evaluating Options
- A. Vancomycin and azithromycin: This combination is typically used for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or certain skin infections, not primarily for the described bacteria.
- B. Piperacillin: While piperacillin has broad-spectrum activity, it lacks coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and some anaerobic gram-negative rods.
- C. Cefazolin and doxycycline: This combination is more suitable for skin infections or certain systemic infections but does not adequately cover the described bacteria.
- D. Ampicillin and sulbactam: This combination provides broad-spectrum coverage, including against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which fits the description of the bacteria in question.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Given the need for broad-spectrum coverage that includes anaerobic gram-negative rods capable of growing in bile, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is Ampicillin and sulbactam. This combination effectively addresses both aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative infections, making it suitable for treating the described condition.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
