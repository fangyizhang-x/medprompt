## Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms
The patient presents with acute onset headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, fingertips and toes turning blue (cyanosis), and a chocolate brown color of his blood while drawing it for laboratory workup. These symptoms are indicative of a severe condition affecting multiple organ systems.

## Step 2: Consider the context of travel to Ecuador
The patient is planning to visit Ecuador, which is in South America, where malaria is prevalent but not typically caused by Plasmodium falciparum, the species responsible for the most severe form of malaria. The fact that primaquine is being taken daily and for 7 consecutive days after leaving Ecuador suggests a specific type of malaria prophylaxis.

## Step 3: Evaluate the use of primaquine
Primaquine is typically used to prevent relapse of certain types of malaria, such as vivax and ovale, in areas where these parasites are endemic. However, it can also cause hemolysis (red blood cell destruction) in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency or those who have taken certain medications that affect G6PD activity.

## Step 4: Consider the role of magnesium supplement
The patient is taking a magnesium supplement, which could be relevant if there was an adverse interaction between this medication and primaquine. However, without more information on how magnesium interacts with primaquine, it's difficult to assess its potential impact on the condition described.

## Step 5: Assess the symptoms and laboratory findings
Given the acute onset of symptoms such as headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, cyanosis, and a chocolate brown color of the blood, along with the patient's travel history to Ecuador where malaria is prevalent but not typically caused by Plasmodium falciparum, it is likely that the condition is related to primaquine use. The symptoms suggest hemolysis, which could be due to primaquine-induced hemolytic anemia.

## Step 6: Determine the most likely cause of the patient's condition
Considering the above steps, the most plausible explanation for the patient's condition is a type B adverse drug reaction involving primaquine and magnesium supplement. Type B reactions are characterized by a hypersensitivity reaction that can be severe but typically does not result in life-threatening complications.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
