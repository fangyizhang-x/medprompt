(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's first understand the context and the pathophysiology involved.

1. **Context**: A 45-year-old man presents with a lodged ureteral stone causing right-sided flank pain. This indicates that the stone is obstructing the flow of urine from the kidney to the bladder.
2. **Pathophysiology**: When an object (in this case, a ureteral stone) lodges in the urinary tract, it can cause obstruction and potentially lead to infection or further complications if not treated promptly.

3. **Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)**: The GFR is a measure of kidney function, representing the volume of fluid filtered from the renal glomeruli into the Bowman's capsule per unit time. It is an important indicator of kidney health and function.

4. **Effect of Obstruction on Glomerular Filtration**: When there is an obstruction in the urinary tract, such as a ureteral stone, it can reduce blood flow to the kidneys. This reduction in blood flow decreases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) because less fluid is being filtered through the glomeruli.

5. **Expected Changes at the Level of Glomerular Filtration**:
   - A: Increase in glomerular capillary oncotic pressure would actually decrease GFR, not increase it.
   - B: An increase in Bowman's space hydrostatic pressure could potentially increase GFR by increasing the pressure within the Bowman's capsule and pushing more fluid through the glomeruli. However, this is not a direct consequence of an obstruction causing a reduction in blood flow to the kidneys.
   - C: The filtration fraction (FF) is defined as the ratio of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to renal plasma flow (RPF). An increase in GFR would lead to an increase in FF, indicating that more fluid is being filtered through the glomeruli. This is not expected with an obstruction.
   - D: No change in filtration fraction is expected because the reduction in blood flow due to the obstruction directly decreases the glomerular filtration rate.

Therefore, considering the pathophysiology of kidney function and the effects of an obstruction on renal blood flow, the most logical conclusion is that there would be no change in the filtration fraction.
