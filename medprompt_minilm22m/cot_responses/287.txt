## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key concepts and processes involved.

1. **Exercise-induced increase in glycogen breakdown**: During exercise, especially when it is strenuous or prolonged, the body's demand for energy increases significantly. To meet this increased demand, the muscle cells (muscle fibers) need to break down stored glycogen into glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), which can then be used as an energy source.

2. **Role of glycogen phosphorylase**: Glycogen phosphorylase is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen into G6P. This process is crucial for increasing blood glucose levels during exercise when glucose is not readily available from food sources.

3. **Phosphorylation and activation of enzymes**: The activity of glycogen phosphorylase can be regulated by various mechanisms, including phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification that activates enzymes by adding a phosphate group to the enzyme's active site.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Decrease in protein kinase A**: Protein kinase A (PKA) is an enzyme involved in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction and glycogen breakdown. However, its activity is not directly related to the increase in glycogen breakdown during exercise.

B. **Activation of phosphorylase kinase**: Phosphorylase kinase is a key regulatory enzyme in the glycogen breakdown pathway. It catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups from ATP to glycogen phosphorylase, activating it and increasing its activity. This process is essential for increasing blood glucose levels during exercise.

C. **Increase in glucose-6-phosphate**: While an increase in G6P would be beneficial for energy production, it is not directly related to the activation of glycogen phosphorylase or the intracellular finding described in the question.

D. **Inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase**: Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) is involved in regulating glycogen synthesis rather than breakdown. Its activity would actually decrease during exercise, as it would inhibit glycogen phosphorylase and reduce glycogen breakdown.

Therefore, based on our understanding of the processes involved, the correct answer is B. Activation of phosphorylase kinase, which best explains the intracellular finding of a substantial increase in the breakdown of glycogen in muscle cells during an exercise stress test.
