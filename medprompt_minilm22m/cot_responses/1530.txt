To answer this question, let's consider the patient's symptoms and the prescribed medication.

The patient is experiencing significant emotional distress, including feelings of guilt, fear, and anxiety about his job security and the future of his family. These symptoms are consistent with major depressive disorder (MDD), which is often treated with antidepressants like citalopram (Celexa) and buspirone (Buspar).

Buspirone is a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic medication that is primarily used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). While it can have some side effects, they are generally different from those associated with benzodiazepines like alprazolam (Xanax) or clonazepam (Klonopin).

The most commonly seen side effect of buspirone is drowsiness. This is because buspirone works by increasing the activity of serotonin in the brain, which can lead to a sedating effect on the body.

In contrast, lightheadedness (A) and respiratory depression (C) are more commonly associated with benzodiazepines like alprazolam or clonazepam. These medications can cause drowsiness, but it is typically not as pronounced as with buspirone.

Dry mouth (B) may be a side effect of many medications, including antidepressants and antihistamines, but it is not the most commonly seen side effect of buspirone.

Sleepwalking (D) is a rare side effect associated with certain medications, including sedatives like zolpidem (Ambien). However, this is not typically seen with buspirone.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the typical side effects of buspirone, the most commonly seen side effect is lightheadedness.
