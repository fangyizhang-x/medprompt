## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation with a severe pulsatile headache, palpitations, and elevated plasma metanephrines on urgent urinalysis, the most likely diagnosis is pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that secretes excess catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline). This condition can cause episodes of hypertension, headache, palpitations, sweating, and anxiety.

The management of pheochromocytoma typically involves controlling blood pressure to prevent cardiovascular complications. The first-line treatment for acute hypertension in patients with pheochromocytoma is the use of alpha-blockers or beta-blockers to reduce blood pressure.

## Step 1: Identify the appropriate initial treatment for pheochromocytoma.
The initial treatment should aim at reducing blood pressure and preventing hypertensive crises. Alpha-blockers are generally preferred over beta-blockers due to their better safety profile in this context.

## Step 2: Consider the options provided.
A. Propranolol followed by phenoxybenzamine - This option involves a gradual increase in alpha-blockade, which may not be ideal for acute hypertension management.
B. Phenoxybenzamine followed by propranolol - This is the correct sequence of treatment for pheochromocytoma. Phenoxybenzamine is an alpha-blocker that blocks the alpha receptors on the blood vessels, reducing peripheral resistance and lowering blood pressure. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that reduces heart rate and myocardial contractility, further lowering blood pressure.
C. Amlodipine - This is a calcium channel blocker used to treat hypertension but not typically for pheochromocytoma.
D. Hydralazine - This is an antihypertensive agent that can be used in acute hypertension management but is not the first-line treatment for pheochromocytoma.

## Step 3: Select the appropriate next step based on the initial diagnosis and treatment plan.
Given the patient's presentation with severe hypertension, palpitations, and elevated plasma metanephrines, the most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate alpha-blockade with phenoxybenzamine to control blood pressure.

The final answer is: $\boxed{B}$
