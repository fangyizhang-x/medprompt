To address this question, let's break down the key points and analyze each statement in relation to what we know about RSV bronchiolitis and its potential long-term effects on respiratory health.

1. **Understanding RSV Bronchiolitis**: RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) is a common virus that affects infants and young children, causing severe respiratory illness. In the case of 6-month-old male patient who was diagnosed with RSV bronchiolitis two months prior, it's essential to consider whether this condition has any long-term implications for his future respiratory health.

2. **Reactive Airway Disease (RAD)**: Reactive airway disease refers to conditions that affect the airways in response to various triggers, such as infections or allergens. In the context of RSV bronchiolitis, it's plausible that the inflammation and irritation caused by the virus could lead to long-term changes in the airways.

3. **Analyzing Statement A**: "There is no clear relationship between RSV and the development of asthma." This statement suggests a lack of evidence linking RSV with an increased risk of developing asthma. However, it's essential to consider that some studies have suggested a possible link between early exposure to RSV and an increased risk of developing asthma later in life.

4. **Analyzing Statement B**: "Your child has a less than 5% chance of developing asthma." This statement implies a very low risk of developing asthma based on the patient's history with RSV bronchiolitis. However, it's crucial to recognize that this is speculative and may not accurately reflect the long-term risks associated with RSV.

5. **Analyzing Statement C**: "Your child has a greater than 20% chance of developing asthma." This statement suggests a higher risk of developing asthma compared to the general population. Given the potential for long-term airway changes following RSV bronchiolitis, it's plausible that this patient could be at an increased risk.

6. **Analyzing Statement D**: "Your childâ€™s risk of asthma is less than the general population." This statement implies a lower risk of developing asthma compared to the general population. However, considering the potential for long-term airway changes following RSV bronchiolitis, it's more accurate to suggest that this patient has an increased risk.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer would be **C**: "Your child
