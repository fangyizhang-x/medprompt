Given the patient's history of chaotic relationships, shopping sprees on impulse, and physical injuries, it is essential to consider a diagnosis that encompasses these symptoms.

Firstly, the patient's history of suicidal ideation and feelings of being abandoned are significant concerns. However, her denial of changes in appetite, energy level, or concentration suggests that she may not be experiencing the typical symptoms of depression.

The presence of multiple linear lacerations on her forearms and trunk is a critical finding. This type of injury is often associated with self-inflicted wounds, which can be indicative of intentional harm. The fact that the patient reports feeling bored easily and moving on to the next adventure suggests a lack of emotional distress or trauma.

The patient's praise for physicians being "the best people on the planet" followed by her verbal abuse towards nurses upon examination is concerning. This behavior pattern is characteristic of a specific personality disorder: Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another (FDIA).

In FDIA, an individual fabricates or fakes symptoms to assume the sick role and gain attention, sympathy, and emotional support from others. They often have a history of trauma or abuse and may exhibit manipulative behaviors towards healthcare providers.

The combination of the patient's chaotic relationships, self-inflicted injuries, and verbal abuse towards nurses is highly suggestive of FDIA. While Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) could also be present, the presence of intentional harm and manipulative behavior towards others makes FDIA a more likely diagnosis.

Bipolar I disorder may involve mood swings and changes in energy levels, but it does not typically include self-inflicted injuries or a history of trauma. Borderline personality disorder involves intense emotional dysregulation and unstable relationships, but it is not characterized by intentional harm to oneself or others.
