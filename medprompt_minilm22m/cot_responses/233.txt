Given the patient's presentation with a firm nodular lump on the left side of her labia, which is accompanied by visible excoriations but no white plaque-like lesions, the most likely diagnosis is lichen sclerosus. Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the genital area, particularly in older women.

The patient's medical history is notable for hypertension and coronary artery disease status post-CABG, which increases her risk for cardiovascular events. However, these factors do not directly relate to the current presentation of the nodular lump on the labia.

Considering the physical examination findings, a small nodular lump with visible excoriations but no white plaque-like lesions is highly suggestive of lichen sclerosus. The next best step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis through a diagnostic test that can provide tissue samples for histopathological examination.

HPV DNA testing (A) may be relevant if there were concerns about a sexually transmitted infection, but it does not directly address the clinical presentation of lichen sclerosus.

Estrogen level measurement (B) might be useful in evaluating hormonal influences on skin conditions like lichen sclerosus, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and medical history.

Pap smear (C) is a screening test for cervical cancer, which is not directly related to this clinical presentation. While there may be some overlap in terms of risk factors (e.g., HPV infection), the Pap smear is not the best choice for evaluating lichen sclerosus.

Vulvar punch biopsy (D) is the most appropriate next step in management. This procedure involves taking a small tissue sample from the affected area, which can then be examined under a microscope to confirm the diagnosis of lichen sclerosus and rule out other potential causes of the symptoms. The biopsy will provide valuable information for guiding further treatment and management.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and patient history, the next best step in management is vulvar punch biopsy.
