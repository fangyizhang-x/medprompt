## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Unintentional weight loss and sleep hyperhidrosis**: These symptoms can be indicative of chronic inflammation or infection.
2. **Persistent cough**: This symptom could suggest an underlying respiratory issue, possibly related to granulomas given their description.
3. **Imaging findings**: The presence of many granulomas in the upper lobes with centers of necrosis and pale cytoplasm is characteristic of sarcoidosis, a condition that often presents with these features.

Given this context, let's consider the surface markers listed:

- **A. CD8**: This marker is typically associated with cytotoxic T cells, which are involved in cell-mediated immunity but not specifically linked to granulomatous inflammation.
  
- **B. CD4**: These cells are a type of T helper cell that plays a crucial role in the immune system's response, including the activation and coordination of other immune cells. However, they are not specific for granulomas or sarcoidosis.

- **C. CD3**: This is a component of the T-cell receptor complex on the surface of T cells. While it is involved in the process of T-cell activation, it's not specifically associated with granulomatous inflammation.

- **D. CD14**: This marker is expressed on the surface of monocytes and macrophages, which are key components of the innate immune system. It plays a role in recognizing bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and other pathogens, making it highly relevant to the granulomatous inflammation seen in sarcoidosis.

Given the clinical presentation suggestive of sarcoidosis, the surface marker most specific for these cells would be CD14, as it is directly involved in the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns that are characteristic of granulomatous inflammation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
