The key to answering this question lies in understanding the pathophysiology of cyanosis and its relationship with cardiac anatomy and physiology.

Firstly, let's define what cyanosis is: Cyanosis is a condition characterized by a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to an increased amount of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood. This can occur when there is a significant difference in oxygen saturation between arterial and venous blood.

In this case, the baby's cyanosis is likely due to a right-to-left shunt, where deoxygenated blood from the lungs bypasses the pulmonary circulation and directly enters the systemic circulation. This can be caused by various factors, including congenital heart defects.

Now, let's consider the options provided:

A. Right ventricular outflow obstruction: This would lead to increased pressure in the right ventricle, which could cause right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). However, RVH is not directly related to the severity of cyanosis.

B. Left ventricular outflow obstruction: Similar to right ventricular outflow obstruction, left ventricular outflow obstruction would increase the workload on the left ventricle and potentially lead to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Again, LVH is not a direct determinant of the severity of cyanosis.

C. Right ventricular hypertrophy: As mentioned earlier, RVH can occur due to increased pressure in the right ventricle, which could be caused by various factors including right ventricular outflow obstruction or other conditions that increase the workload on the right ventricle. However, it is not directly related to the severity of cyanosis.

D. Atrial septal defect (ASD): An ASD is a type of congenital heart defect characterized by an abnormal opening in the atrial septum, allowing blood to flow between the left and right atria. This can lead to increased volume load on the right ventricle, which may cause RVH. Additionally, the increased pressure gradient across the pulmonary valve due to ASD can also contribute to right-to-left shunting.

Given this information, the main determinant of the severity of cyanosis in this patient is likely related to the presence and characteristics of an atrial septal defect (ASD), as it directly affects the right ventricle's workload and potential for RVH. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final model answer is: D
