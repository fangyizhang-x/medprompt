(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation with allergic rhinitis symptoms that occur every September at the start of the school year, it is likely that his symptoms are triggered by seasonal allergens such as ragweed pollen. The presence of a family history of childhood asthma and eczema also suggests a possible allergic component to these conditions.

Intranasal antihistamines (A) may provide relief for mild to moderate allergic rhinitis symptoms but would not address the underlying cause of his symptoms, which is likely an allergic reaction to seasonal allergens. Intranasal cromolyn sodium (B) is a mast cell stabilizer that can be used to prevent allergic reactions in susceptible individuals, but it may not provide immediate relief for acute symptoms.

Intranasal decongestants (C) are typically used to relieve nasal congestion and sinus pressure associated with colds or allergies. However, they do not address the underlying allergic inflammation and may even exacerbate symptoms if taken long-term without medical supervision.

Intranasal corticosteroids (D) are a first-line treatment for allergic rhinitis due to their potent anti-inflammatory effects. They can help reduce nasal congestion, itching, and postnasal drip by decreasing the production of inflammatory mediators in the nasal passages. Given the patient's symptoms occur every September at the start of the school year, which is likely triggered by seasonal allergens, starting treatment with intranasal corticosteroids would be an appropriate next step to manage his symptoms effectively.

Therefore, the most appropriate medication for this patient's condition is intranasal corticosteroids.
