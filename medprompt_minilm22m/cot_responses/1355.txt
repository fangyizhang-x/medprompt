## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of a 17-year-old girl with amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), normal breast development, coarse pubic hair extending to the inner surface of the thighs, and a blind vaginal pouch on pelvic examination, along with ultrasonography showing ovaries but no uterus, we can consider several potential underlying causes.

Firstly, let's rule out some options based on the provided information:

- **Müllerian duct agenesis (B)**: This condition involves the underdevelopment or absence of the Müllerian ducts, which are responsible for forming the female reproductive tract. However, in this case, ultrasonography shows ovaries but no uterus, making this option less likely.

- **Androgen insensitivity syndrome (C)**: While this condition can cause virilization of females, leading to coarse pubic hair and other male-like features, it typically does not result in the absence of a uterus or blind vaginal pouch. Therefore, we can exclude this option as well.

- **Pure gonadal dysgenesis (D)**: This is a rare condition where one or both ovaries fail to develop properly, leading to a lack of estrogen production and subsequent failure to develop secondary sexual characteristics. However, it often results in the presence of a uterus and normal Müllerian ducts, which contradicts the provided information.

This leaves us with **17-alpha-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency (A)** as the most likely underlying cause. This condition is characterized by an inability to produce cortisol from cholesterol, leading to an overproduction of androgens. The symptoms presented in this case are consistent with 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency:

- **Androgen excess**: The presence of coarse pubic hair, deep voice, and other male-like features due to the excessive production of androgens.
- **Amenorrhea**: The absence of menstruation is likely due to the high levels of androgens, which can suppress the normal menstrual cycle.
- **Normal breast development**: This suggests that the ovaries are producing estrogen, which promotes breast development.
- **Blind vaginal pouch (Müllerian duct agenesis)**: The presence of a blind vaginal pouch is consistent with 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, as this condition often results in the underdevelopment or absence of the Müllerian ducts.

Therefore, based on the provided clinical presentation and ultrasonography
