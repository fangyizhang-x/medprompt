## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The investigator is observing changes in heart rate and other physiological parameters between normal mice and genetically modified mice after aerobic exercise. The key finding here is that the average pulse measured in the normal mice is 680/min, whereas in the genetically modified mice it is only 160/min.

To understand why this difference might occur, let's consider each option:

A. Greater cardiomyocyte size: While larger cardiomyocytes could potentially increase heart rate by allowing for more efficient contraction, there is no indication that the normal mice have larger cardiomyocytes than the genetically modified mice. In fact, the opposite might be true - the genetically modified mice may have smaller cardiomyocytes.

B. Greater ratio of heart to body weight: This option is not directly relevant to the observed difference in heart rate between the two groups. The ratio of heart to body weight would likely remain similar between normal and genetically modified mice.

C. Lower number of gap junctions: Gap junctions are critical for coordinating action potentials between cardiomyocytes, allowing for efficient contraction. A lower number of gap junctions could indeed lead to a decrease in heart rate, as there would be fewer channels for electrical signals to pass through. This option is a plausible explanation for the observed difference.

D. Greater T-tubule density: T-tubules are specialized structures that facilitate the transmission of action potentials from the sarcolemma (cell membrane) to the interior of the muscle cell. A greater number of T-tubules could potentially increase the efficiency of electrical signal transmission, leading to a faster heart rate. However, there is no indication in this scenario that the genetically modified mice have more T-tubules than normal mice.

Given these considerations, the most likely explanation for the increased heart rate seen in the normal mice is a lower number of gap junctions, which would lead to decreased coordination and efficiency of electrical signal transmission between cardiomyocytes, resulting in a faster heart rate.
