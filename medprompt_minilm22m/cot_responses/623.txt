Given the clinical presentation and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is primary aldosteronism (PA), a condition characterized by excessive production of aldosterone from the adrenal glands. The elevated plasma renin activity (PRA) ratio with no response to oral salt loading testing supports this diagnosis.

The CT scan showing a 2 cm mass on the left side of the adrenal gland further supports the suspicion of an adrenal adenoma, which is a common cause of primary aldosteronism.

Considering the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the best next step would be to confirm the diagnosis by obtaining a tissue sample from the suspected mass. This can be done through adrenal venous sampling (AVS), which involves inserting a catheter into one of the adrenal veins to obtain a biopsy sample.

AVS is considered the gold standard for diagnosing primary aldosteronism, as it allows for direct visualization and histological examination of the adrenal gland tissue. It is less invasive than other methods, such as laparoscopic adrenalectomy or renal angiogram, which may not provide sufficient tissue for diagnosis.

Treatment with eplerenone (D) would be appropriate after confirming the diagnosis through AVS, as it is a medication that can block the effects of aldosterone without affecting renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activity. However, before starting treatment, further diagnostic testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of hypertension.

Therefore, the best next step for this patient would be adrenal venous sampling (B), which allows for direct confirmation of the diagnosis and preparation for potential treatment with eplerenone after AVS.
