## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Step 1: Analyzing the clinical presentation and physical examination findings
The patient presents with a rapidly enlarging mass on the central part of his neck, fatigue, and recurrent fevers. The presence of multiple enlarged submandibular and cervical lymph nodes that are firm, mobile, and non-tender is highly suggestive of lymphadenopathy. This pattern is characteristic of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), particularly in its early stages.

### Step 2: Understanding the biopsy results
The biopsy showing predominantly lymphocytes and histiocytes present in a "resembling popcorn" pattern is indicative of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are characteristic of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The absence of CD15 and CD30 positivity on flow cytometry analysis helps to rule out other types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) that typically express these markers.

### Step 3: Evaluating the histopathological features
The presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are large, multinucleated cells with abundant cytoplasm and a distinctive "popcorn" appearance under the microscope, is diagnostic for classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The absence of CD19 positivity in the biopsy sample further supports this diagnosis.

### Step 4: Considering the patient's age and lack of smoking history
While age can be a factor in some types of NHL, it is not a primary differentiator between classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) and other subtypes. The absence of significant smoking history also does not rule out CHL, as smoking is a risk factor for many NHL subtypes.

### Step 5: Evaluating the patient's symptoms
The patient's fatigue and recurrent fevers could be related to the underlying disease process or its treatment. However, in the context of this diagnosis, they are less likely to be directly caused by the lymphoma itself.

### Step 6: Considering the options provided
Given the biopsy results and clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL). The options can be evaluated as follows:

- A. Lymphocyte rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma: This subtype typically has a more favorable prognosis than classical Hodgkin lymphoma but does not match the biopsy findings.
- B. Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL): NLPHL is characterized by a predominance of lymphocytes and often presents with nodules
