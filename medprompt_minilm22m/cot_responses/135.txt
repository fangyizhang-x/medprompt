## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given that the study was conducted with a total of 7,000 participants instead of 14,000, we need to consider how this change affects the sample size calculations and subsequently the estimates.

Firstly, let's calculate the required sample size for each cohort in the original trial:

- For the rivaroxaban group: n1 = (1 - 0.5) * 14,000 = 7,000
- For the warfarin group: n2 = (1 - 0.5) * 14,000 = 7,000

Since both groups have the same sample size requirement, we can assume that the study design and statistical analysis are similar for both cohorts.

Now, let's consider the effect of reducing the sample size from 14,000 to 7,000 on the estimates:

- The hazard ratio (HR) is calculated as the incidence rate in the rivaroxaban group divided by the incidence rate in the warfarin group. Since the incidence rates are proportional to the sample sizes, the HR will also be reduced proportionally.
- The 95% confidence interval (CI) is calculated using the formula: CI = (HR * SE1, HR * SE2), where SE1 and SE2 are the standard errors of the estimates for each cohort. Since both cohorts have the same sample size requirement, the standard errors will be similar.

Given that the hazard ratio is reduced from 0.79 to 0.64, we can expect:

- The estimated effect size (the difference between the two groups) will decrease proportionally.
- The confidence interval range will increase because the standard error of the estimate for each cohort will also increase due to the smaller sample size.

Therefore, the most expected change is an increased risk of confounding bias. This is because a smaller sample size can lead to overestimation or underestimation of the effect size, which may not accurately reflect the true relationship between the variables being studied.

The other options are incorrect:

A. Decreased hazard ratio: The hazard ratio would actually increase due to the reduced sample size.

B. Increased confidence interval range: The standard error of the estimate for each cohort will increase with a smaller sample size, leading to an increased confidence interval range.

C. Decreased type I error rate: A smaller sample size can lead to overrejection of null hypotheses, resulting in a higher type I
