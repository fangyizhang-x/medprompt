Given the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the next best step in management would be to assess for and manage potential electrolyte imbalances due to his hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose levels). The presence of visible jugular pulsations suggests dehydration, which is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. Dehydration can lead to hypovolemia, decreased renal perfusion, and potentially acute kidney injury.

The patient's laboratory findings indicate that he has mild hyperglycemia (Hb A1c 7.5%) and elevated fasting blood glucose levels (120 mg/dL). These values are consistent with diabetes mellitus type 2, which is a common cause of polyuria (frequent urination) due to the body's inability to regulate blood sugar effectively.

The management of hyperglycemia in diabetic patients requires careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks of different treatment options. However, given the patient's current presentation, stopping metformin may not be the best initial step as it is a first-line medication for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, replacing captopril with valsartan or starting rosiglitazone would not address the underlying issue of hyperglycemia.

Exenatide is an insulin secretagogue that stimulates the release of insulin from the pancreas. While it may be beneficial in some patients with type 2 diabetes, it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for managing hyperglycemia due to its potential side effects and the availability of more effective treatments like metformin.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to start metformin, which has been shown to improve glycemic control in diabetic patients. This medication can help reduce blood glucose levels and alleviate symptoms such as polyuria. It is essential to monitor the patient's response to treatment closely and adjust his medication regimen as needed to optimize glycemic control.

## Answer Explanation:
The key points that led to this conclusion are:

1. The presence of visible jugular pulsations, which suggests dehydration.
2. Mild hyperglycemia (Hb A1c 7.5%) and elevated fasting blood glucose levels (120 mg/dL), consistent with diabetes mellitus type 2.
3. The patient's current presentation does not necessitate immediate changes to his medication regimen.

Therefore, the answer is A.
