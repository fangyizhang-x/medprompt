## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, including double vision that is constant and not improving with time, drooping eyelid (ptosis), and a poorly reactive pupil, these signs are highly suggestive of Horner syndrome. This condition can be caused by various factors, including diabetes mellitus, which is supported by the patient's laboratory study showing an Hb A1c level of 5.0%.

The next best test for this patient would be to further evaluate the cause of her Horner syndrome and assess for any potential complications or associated conditions.

## Step 1: Evaluate the relevance of each option
- Direct fundoscopy (A) is a useful tool for examining the retina, but it does not directly address the suspected underlying cause of Horner syndrome.
- Intraocular pressures (B) are important in assessing glaucoma, which can also present with similar symptoms such as double vision and ptosis. However, this patient's primary complaint is not related to eye pressure.
- MR angiography of the head (C) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can help identify vascular abnormalities or conditions affecting blood flow to the brain, including those that could be causing Horner syndrome.
- Temporal artery biopsy (D) is typically used to diagnose temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis), which can cause similar symptoms such as double vision and eyelid drooping. However, this patient's presentation does not strongly suggest giant cell arteritis.

## Step 2: Consider the potential complications of diabetes
Given that the patient has a high Hb A1c level, it is essential to consider potential complications associated with diabetes, including diabetic retinopathy, which can cause vision changes and potentially lead to Horner syndrome. Therefore, further evaluation of the retina would be prudent.

## Step 3: Select the most appropriate next step
Considering the patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and laboratory results, the most logical next step is to perform an MR angiography of the head to evaluate for potential vascular causes of her Horner syndrome. This will help identify any underlying conditions that could be contributing to her symptoms.

The final answer is: C
