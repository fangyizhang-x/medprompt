## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of multiple nodules on the hands, firm, mobile, and nontender, along with a family history of myocardial infarction at a young age and rheumatoid arthritis in the mother, we can consider several potential mechanisms underlying this patient's skin findings.

Firstly, considering the familial aspect of the myocardial infarction, it is essential to rule out conditions that are known to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. One such condition is Marfan syndrome, which is characterized by aortic root dilatation and can lead to atherosclerosis and subsequent myocardial infarction.

The presence of nodules on the hands could be indicative of a systemic condition that affects multiple organ systems. Given the patient's occupation as a computer game programmer, it is possible that he spends long hours sitting or standing, which may contribute to the development of skin lesions.

Among the options provided:

A. Fibrinoid necrosis - This is typically associated with vasculitis and is not directly related to the clinical presentation described.

B. Crystallization of monosodium urate (MSU) - MSU gout can cause nodules, but it is more commonly associated with acute inflammatory episodes rather than a chronic condition like the one described here.

C. Uncontrolled adipocyte growth - This option is highly relevant to the patient's occupation as a computer game programmer. Prolonged sitting or standing can lead to increased pressure on the veins in the legs, which may result in varicose veins and eventually, venous insufficiency. This condition can cause skin lesions, including nodules.

D. Extravasation of lipoproteins - While this option is related to vascular conditions, it is not directly linked to the clinical presentation described.

Given these considerations, the most likely mechanism underlying this patient's skin findings is uncontrolled adipocyte growth, which could be exacerbated by his occupation and lifestyle factors.

The final answer is: C
