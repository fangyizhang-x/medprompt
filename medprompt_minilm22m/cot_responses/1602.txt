Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, this question requires careful consideration of his condition and treatment options.

Firstly, the patient's fatigue and difficulty initiating urination are suggestive of an overactive bladder (OAB), which is often associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The firm, non-tender, and uniformly enlarged prostate on digital rectal examination further supports this diagnosis. BPH can cause urinary retention, especially at night, leading to nocturia.

The patient's elevated blood pressure (166/82 mm Hg) is also a concern, as it may be related to his hypertension or the underlying condition causing his symptoms.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be an alpha-blocker that can help relax the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, reducing urinary retention and improving urine flow. Among the options provided:

A. Phenoxybenzamine is a non-selective alpha-blocker used to treat pheochromocytoma, which is not indicated here.

B. Tamsulosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker that selectively relaxes the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, making it an excellent choice for treating BPH symptoms. It has a favorable side effect profile and is generally well-tolerated.

C. Terazosin is also an alpha-blocker but is less selective than tamsulosin, which may lead to more side effects such as dizziness and orthostatic hypotension.

D. Î±-Methyldopa is primarily used for the treatment of hypertension and can have side effects that may not be suitable for this patient, especially given his elevated blood pressure.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and the need to address both BPH and hypertension, tamsulosin would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy.
