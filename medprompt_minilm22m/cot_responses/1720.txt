Given the patient's symptoms, including coughing up blood-tinged sputum with clots, decreased urination (dysuria), and a history of smoking, we can deduce that he likely has a condition affecting his kidneys. The presence of dried blood around the lips further supports this suspicion.

The negative serum antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody test helps to rule out granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), which are both forms of vasculitis that can affect the kidneys. These conditions typically present with more severe symptoms, including hemoptysis and renal failure.

The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 2.9 mg/dL, indicating impaired kidney function. This is consistent with a variety of kidney diseases, but given the context, we should consider those that are associated with smoking and can cause chronic kidney damage.

Option A (Neutrophilic infiltration of the capillaries) is more typical of conditions like acute interstitial nephritis or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. While these conditions can cause renal dysfunction, they do not typically present with coughing up blood-tinged sputum.

Option B (Thinning of the basement membrane) is characteristic of membranous nephropathy, which can be associated with smoking and can lead to chronic kidney disease. However, it does not typically present with hemoptysis or the specific constellation of symptoms described in this case.

Option C (Fibrin crescents in Bowman space) is indicative of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), a condition that often presents with severe renal failure and can be associated with smoking. RPGN is characterized by the formation of fibrin deposits in Bowman's space, which can lead to rapid kidney damage.

Option D (Enlarged and hypercellular glomeruli) is more typical of conditions like focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which can cause nephrotic syndrome but does not typically present with hemoptysis or the specific symptoms described in this case.

Given the patient's history, symptoms, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). Therefore, the biopsy specimen of the kidney is most likely to show fibrin crescents in Bowman space.
