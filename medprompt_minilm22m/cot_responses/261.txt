## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, we can rule out some options first.

- The patient has a history of colon cancer (colectomy at age 43), which increases his risk for certain types of skin cancers. However, the current presentation does not strongly suggest a skin cancer.
- The presence of a firm, mobile, painless nodule on the neck without any signs of inflammation or infection makes it less likely to be an abscess or a collection of pus (e.g., abscess).
- The fact that the skin over the nodule cannot be pinched suggests that it is not a fluid-filled lesion.
- The patient's occupation as a traffic warden and frequent exposure to sunlight may increase his risk for certain types of skin cancers, but this does not directly explain the presence of a firm, mobile nodule on the neck.

Considering these factors, let's evaluate the options:

A. Actinic keratosis - This is a common precursor to squamous cell carcinoma, especially in individuals with a history of sun exposure and smoking. However, actinic keratosis typically presents as a rough, scaly patch or plaque, which does not match the smooth, firm nodule described.

B. Epidermoid cyst - These are benign growths that can occur on the skin, but they are usually painless and mobile, which does not fit the patient's description.

C. Dermatofibroma - This is a type of benign fibrous tumor that typically presents as a firm, painless nodule or bump. It often occurs in areas with thick skin, such as the neck, and can be associated with sun exposure. Given the patient's history of sun exposure (colectomy) and his current presentation, this option seems more likely.

D. Squamous cell carcinoma - While it is a type of skin cancer that could present as a firm, mobile nodule on the neck, squamous cell carcinoma typically has a different appearance than what is described here. It may have a rough or scaly texture, and often presents with pain or tenderness.

Based on this analysis, the most likely diagnosis for the patient's presentation is a dermatofibroma, given his history of sun exposure and the physical characteristics of the nodule.
