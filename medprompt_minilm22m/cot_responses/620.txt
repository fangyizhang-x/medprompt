## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's consider the key points from the patient's history and physical examination:

1. **Pain location and reproduction**: The pain is located in the left shoulder and is reproduced when the shoulder is externally rotated against resistance. This suggests that the injury may be related to a muscle or tendon that is involved in external rotation of the shoulder.

2. **Physical activity and baseball play**: The patient is physically active, which means he likely engages in activities that require strength and stability in his shoulders. Baseball also involves throwing and catching, which can put additional stress on the shoulder joint and surrounding muscles.

3. **Tendons involved in external rotation**: External rotation of the shoulder is primarily facilitated by two tendons: the supraspinatus tendon and the infraspinatus tendon. The teres minor tendon also assists with internal rotation but is not primarily responsible for external rotation.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Teres major**: This muscle is involved in adduction (bringing the arm towards the body) of the shoulder joint and is not primarily responsible for external rotation.

B. **Pectoralis major**: While the pectoralis major muscle does contribute to shoulder movement, it is not directly involved in external rotation of the shoulder.

C. **Infraspinatus tendon**: This tendon is a primary contributor to external rotation of the shoulder joint and is located on the side of the shoulder closest to the point of injury (the supraspinatus tendon). Given that the pain is reproduced when the shoulder is externally rotated, an injury to this tendon is highly likely.

D. **Supraspinatus tendon**: While the supraspinatus tendon does contribute to external rotation, it is more involved in abduction (lifting the arm away from the body) of the shoulder joint and is not primarily responsible for external rotation.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely injured tendon is the infraspinatus tendon.
