## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To identify sickle cell trait in African American infants using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, we need to understand what PCR is used for and how it applies to identifying the trait.

1. **Understanding PCR**: Polymerase chain reaction is a laboratory technique that amplifies specific DNA sequences. It involves heating the sample to separate the DNA strands, allowing them to bind to primers (short sequences of nucleotides), followed by an extension step where the DNA polymerase enzyme synthesizes new DNA strands using the primers and dNTPs (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP).

2. **Identifying Sickle Cell Trait**: The sickle cell trait is a genetic condition that affects hemoglobin production in red blood cells. It occurs when an individual inherits one copy of the HbS gene and one normal allele (HbA). This can lead to the production of abnormal hemoglobin, causing red blood cells to be misshapen and break down prematurely.

3. **Applying PCR for Sickle Cell Trait Identification**: To identify sickle cell trait using PCR, we need to amplify a specific DNA sequence that is associated with this condition. The HbS gene encodes the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin, which is responsible for the abnormal hemoglobin in individuals with sickle cell trait.

4. **Required Components for PCR**: For PCR to be effective in identifying sickle cell trait, we need a DNA sample that contains the specific sequence associated with this condition. This can be obtained from blood samples or other biological materials.

5. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - A. RNA-dependent DNA polymerase is involved in transcription and replication of RNA, not PCR.
   - B. Ligation of Okazaki fragments is a process used in DNA cloning to join together fragments of DNA that have been separated by restriction enzymes.
   - C. Initial sequence of the 3' end of a DNA strand refers to the 5' end (the start point) and 3' end (the end point) of a DNA molecule, which is not directly relevant to PCR or identifying sickle cell trait.
   - D. Complete genome DNA sequence would be required for a comprehensive analysis but is not necessary for identifying sickle cell trait using PCR.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Ligation of Okazaki fragments, as it is involved
