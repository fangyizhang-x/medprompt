## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given that the diameter of her left anterior descending artery (LAD) is 50% of normal, we can infer that the LAD's cross-sectional area has decreased significantly.

When considering flow in a vessel, flow is inversely proportional to the radius of the vessel. Since the diameter has decreased by 50%, the radius has also decreased by half. 

The formula for flow (Q) through a cylindrical vessel is Q = πr^2A / 4L, where r is the radius, A is the cross-sectional area, and L is the length.

Since the blood pressure, LAD length, and blood viscosity have not changed, we can assume that there are no other factors affecting flow. 

Given that the diameter has decreased by 50%, the radius (r) will also decrease by half. Therefore, the new radius will be r' = r / 2.

The cross-sectional area (A) remains unchanged at baseline, so A = πr^2.

Substituting these values into the flow formula, we get:

Q = π(r')^2A / 4L
= π((r/2)^2)πr^2 / 4L
= π(r^2)/8L

Since LAD length (L) has not changed, we can substitute it with its baseline value.

The formula now becomes:

Q = π(r^2)/8L

To find the percentage change in flow, we need to compare this new expression for Q to the original expression. 

Let's calculate the ratio of the new flow to the old flow:

New flow / Old flow = (π(r^2)/8L) / (πr^2/4L)
= 1/2

This means that the new flow is half of the old flow.

Therefore, the answer is D. Decreased by 25%.
