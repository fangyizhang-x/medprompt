## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **High mitotic activity (A)**: While high mitotic activity can be a sign of aggressive tumor behavior, it is not typically associated with a worse prognosis in lung cancer. In fact, high mitotic activity often correlates with better outcomes.

2. **High nucleus to cytoplasmic ratio (B)**: This feature is more commonly seen in small cell carcinoma and other neuroendocrine tumors, which are less common in this case. It's not the worst prognostic factor among the options provided.

3. **Mediastinal invasion (C)**: Mediastinal invasion by lung cancer can be a poor prognostic sign due to its association with lymph node metastasis and distant spread. However, it is still considered a relatively favorable feature compared to other factors listed here.

4. **Poor cellular differentiation (D)**: Poor cellular differentiation is generally associated with a worse prognosis in many cancers because it indicates a more aggressive tumor behavior. In lung cancer, poorly differentiated tumors tend to have higher mitotic rates and are more likely to be of squamous cell origin, which has a poorer prognosis compared to adenocarcinoma.

Considering the options provided and the typical prognostic factors for lung cancer, poor cellular differentiation (D) is the finding that confers the worst prognosis in this patient. This is because it indicates a tumor with aggressive characteristics, such as squamous cell origin, which tends to have a poorer outcome compared to adenocarcinoma.

The final answer is: D
