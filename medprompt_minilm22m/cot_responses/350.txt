## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, which began after physical exertion (playing football), we should consider an acute exacerbation of asthma or a cardiac issue that could be precipitated by exertion. The patient's history of atopic dermatitis and asthma is also relevant.

The presence of tachycardia (pulse of 150/min) and tachypnea (respirations of 22/min) suggests cardiovascular involvement, which is consistent with an acute cardiac issue such as myocardial infarction or severe asthma exacerbation. The patient's oxygen saturation of 85% on room air also indicates hypoxemia.

Considering the options:

A. Albuterol and prednisone: While albuterol (a bronchodilator) is a first-line treatment for acute asthma exacerbations, adding prednisone (a corticosteroid) may be considered if there are signs of severe inflammation or if the patient has a history of chronic asthma. However, this option does not address the immediate need to stabilize the patient's cardiovascular status.

B. IM epinephrine: Epinephrine is a first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, which could be a potential cause of the patient's symptoms. However, given the patient's presentation and history, it's less likely that he has anaphylaxis.

C. IV epinephrine: Similar to IM epinephrine, IV epinephrine is used in anaphylaxis treatment but is not the best initial choice for this scenario.

D. IV fluids and 100% oxygen: This option addresses both the cardiovascular and respiratory components of the patient's presentation. Administering IV fluids can help improve cardiac output and oxygen delivery to tissues, while providing 100% oxygen can help alleviate hypoxemia.

Therefore, the best next step in management is to provide IV fluids and 100% oxygen to address the patient's cardiovascular and respiratory distress, which are likely contributing factors to his symptoms.
