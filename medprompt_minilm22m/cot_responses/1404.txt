## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, we can analyze his current situation step by step:

1. **Current Medications**: The patient is already on metformin, glyburide (an oral hypoglycemic agent), lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor for hypertension), metoprolol (a beta-blocker for hypertension and heart failure symptoms), and hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic for hypertension). This combination of medications is typically used to manage type II diabetes mellitus.

2. **Current Medication Adjustments**: The patient's current medication list includes lisinopril, metformin, glyburide, metoprolol, and hydrochlorothiazide. We need to consider the potential interactions between these medications and how they might affect each other or the patient's condition.

3. **Blood Pressure and Pulse**: The patient's blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, which is slightly elevated but not significantly so for a hypertensive patient. His pulse is 80/min, which is within a normal range. These values do not indicate acute cardiovascular distress.

4. **Fasting Lipid Panel Results**: The patient's fasting lipid panel showed an LDL of 85 mg/dL and triglycerides of 160 mg/dL. Elevated LDL cholesterol (often referred to as "bad" cholesterol) and high triglycerides are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. These values indicate that the patient has dyslipidemia, which is a significant concern.

5. **Current Medication Adjustments**: Considering the patient's current medication list, increasing lisinopril dose (A) might not be necessary as it is already at the maximum recommended dose. Increasing metformin dose (B) could potentially worsen hypoglycemic symptoms in patients with diabetes and may also increase the risk of lactic acidosis due to increased insulin levels.

6. **Statin Therapy**: Statins are lipid-lowering medications that are commonly used to treat dyslipidemia. Given the patient's elevated LDL cholesterol level, statin therapy (C) is a reasonable recommendation to help lower his LDL cholesterol and reduce cardiovascular risk.

7. **Discontinuing Metoprolol and Starting Propranolol**: Discontinuing metoprolol and starting propranolol (D) might not be the best choice as it could lead to orthostatic hypotension, which is
