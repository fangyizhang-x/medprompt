## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and medical history:

1. The patient presents with fatigue and shortness of breath after moving to Denver, which could be related to altitude sickness or other factors.
2. He has a history of smoking, lung cancer removal, and pulmonary fibrosis, which increases his risk for respiratory complications.
3. His family history of progressive restrictive lung disease is concerning.

Now, let's evaluate the laboratory values:

1. The patient's oxygen tension in inspired air (FiO2) is 130%, which is higher than normal (FiO2 = 0.21-0.30).
2. The alveolar carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) is 48 mmHg, which is lower than the normal range (35-45 mmHg). This suggests that the patient is not adequately ventilating and may be experiencing hyperventilation.
3. The arterial oxygen tension (SaO2) is 58%, which is higher than the normal range (75-100%). This indicates that the patient's lungs are extracting more oxygen from the blood than usual, but still not enough to meet their needs.
4. The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) is 0.80, which is within the normal range (1.2-1.5). This suggests that the patient is not hypercapnic or hypocapnic.
5. The patient's respiratory rate is 20/min, which is lower than the normal range (12-20 breaths/min).

Considering these factors, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. High altitude: While high altitude can cause hypoxia and fatigue, the patient's oxygen tension in inspired air is not significantly elevated.

B. Hypoventilation: The patient's PaCO2 is low, which suggests that he may be hypoventilating, leading to inadequate gas exchange.

C. Pulmonary fibrosis: There is no specific indication of pulmonary fibrosis in the patient's history or laboratory values.

D. V/Q mismatch: While there are some issues with ventilation and perfusion, a V/Q mismatch would typically present with more severe symptoms such as bilateral infiltrates on chest radiographs or more pronounced hypoxemia.

Therefore, the most consistent mechanism with these values is hypoventilation, which can lead to inadequate gas exchange, hypercapnia (elevated PaCO2), and fatigue.
