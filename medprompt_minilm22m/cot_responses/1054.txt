## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The mechanism behind the reaction in this patient can be explained by understanding the immune response to a graft.

Firstly, let's consider the context: The patient has undergone deceased donor liver transplantation 3 weeks ago. This means that there is an immunological response against the graft, which is the transplanted organ.

Now, let's analyze the options:

A. CD8+ T lymphocytes reacting against donor MHCs:
CD8+ T cells are a type of cytotoxic T cell that can recognize and kill infected cells or tumor cells. In the context of transplantation, these cells can react against the graft, leading to an immune response.

B. CD4+ T lymphocytes reacting against recipient APCs:
CD4+ T cells are another type of helper T cell that play a crucial role in the adaptive immune response. They help activate other immune cells, such as B cells and cytotoxic T cells. However, they do not typically react directly against graft antigens.

C. Pre-existing recipient antibodies:
While it is possible for the patient to have pre-existing antibodies against the graft, this would likely be due to previous exposure to similar antigens or through immunological tolerance mechanisms.

D. Grafted T lymphocytes reacting against host:
This option suggests that the reaction is directed against the patient's own tissues (the "host") rather than the graft itself. However, in the context of transplantation, it is more common for the immune system to react against the graft rather than the host.

Given these considerations, the most likely mechanism behind this reaction is the activation of CD8+ T lymphocytes reacting against donor MHCs. This is a common phenomenon in transplantation, where the immune system recognizes and responds to antigens presented by the graft's major histocompatibility complex (MHC).

Therefore, the answer is A.
