## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of this 2-year-old child, including rapid breathing, cyanotic appearance of lips, fingers, and toes, mild cyanosis during episodes of agitation, a history of frequent squatting after strenuous activity, evidence of a systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border, and delayed development compared to peers, we can deduce that this child likely has Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), a congenital heart defect characterized by four specific features:

1. **Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)**: A hole in the septum between the two ventricles.
2. **Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction**: The pulmonary valve is narrowed or blocked, preventing blood from flowing from the right ventricle to the lungs.
3. **Overriding Aorta**: The aorta lies above the VSD and pumps blood into the right ventricle directly.
4. **Pulmonary Stenosis**: Narrowing of the pulmonary valve or area where it opens into the right ventricle.

The systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border is indicative of the VSD, as blood flows from the right ventricle to the lungs through this defect.

Given these features and the child's symptoms, a chest X-ray (CXR) would likely show:

- **Boot-shaped heart**: Due to the presence of the VSD, which causes the right ventricle to enlarge and become more prominent on the CXR.
- **Displaced tricuspid valve**: The increased pressure from the VSD can cause the tricuspid valve to be displaced or "displaced" in the left atrium during systole.

The other options are less likely:

- A. Egg on a string: This is not a typical finding in TOF.
- B. Boot-shaped heart: While this might be seen, it's more characteristic of VSDs with significant pulmonary stenosis or other anomalies.
- D. Atrial septal defect (ASD): ASDs are different from TOF and would not explain the child's cyanotic presentation or systolic ejection murmur.

Therefore, the most likely finding on CXR for this child is a boot-shaped heart due to the VSD and displaced tricuspid valve.
