## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of excessive hair growth in a 5-year-old girl, Tanner stage 4 development, and an elevated level of estrogen on laboratory studies, we can rule out several options:

- **Idiopathic precocious puberty (B)**: This condition is characterized by early onset puberty without any identifiable cause. While it's possible, the presence of an ovarian mass and elevated estrogen levels makes this less likely.
- **Granulosa cell tumor (A)**: This type of sex cord-stromal tumor can produce estrogen, leading to precocious puberty. However, granulosa cell tumors are more commonly associated with virilization in males rather than female presentation.

The most likely diagnosis is **McCune-Albright syndrome (C)**. This rare genetic disorder is characterized by the triad of:
  - Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia
  - Osteoporosis
  - Endocrine disorders, including precocious puberty due to ovarian or adrenal tumors

Given the presence of an ovarian mass and elevated estrogen levels in a young girl, McCune-Albright syndrome is a strong consideration. The other options are less likely given the clinical presentation.

## Step 1: Identify the key features of the case
The patient presents with excessive hair growth (Tanner stage 4 development), which suggests precocious puberty. Physical examination reveals an ovarian mass, and laboratory studies show elevated estrogen levels.

## Step 2: Consider the potential diagnoses
Given the combination of precocious puberty, ovarian mass, and elevated estrogen levels, we need to consider rare conditions that can cause these features.

## Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Granulosa cell tumor (A)** is less likely due to its association with virilization in males.
- **Idiopathic precocious puberty (B)** is unlikely given the presence of an ovarian mass and elevated estrogen levels.
- **McCune-Albright syndrome (C)** is a strong consideration given the combination of symptoms.

## Step 4: Make a diagnosis
Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and the rarity of McCune-Albright syndrome, we can conclude that the most likely diagnosis is **McCune-Albright syndrome**.

The final answer is: C
