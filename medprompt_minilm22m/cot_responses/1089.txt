To address this question, we need to consider the potential side effects and interactions associated with each medication listed, particularly in the context of an HIV-positive patient receiving treatment for cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis.

A. Foscarnet is a pyrophosphate analog that has been used as an alternative to ganciclovir for treating CMV retinitis. While it can cause side effects, such as myopathy and lactic acidosis, its primary concern in this context would be related to its potential impact on renal function rather than neutrophil count.

B. Zidovudine (AZT) is an antiretroviral medication that has been associated with a decrease in CD4+ T cell counts over time. However, it does not directly precipitate a deficiency of neutrophils; instead, its impact on the immune system is more related to its effect on lymphocyte count.

C. Efavirenz (Sustiva) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). NNRTIs are known to cause neutropenia as a side effect due to their mechanism of action, which involves the inhibition of viral replication and the induction of apoptosis in infected cells. This can lead to a decrease in the production of white blood cells, including neutrophils.

D. Raltegravir (Reyataz) is also an NNRTI that has been used as part of antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive patients. While it does have side effects, such as headache and nausea, its impact on neutrophil count is not as pronounced as that of efavirenz.

Given the information above, the most likely agent to precipitate a deficiency of neutrophils in an HIV-positive patient receiving treatment for cytomegalovirus retinitis would be Efavirenz (C), due to its known side effect profile and mechanism of action.
