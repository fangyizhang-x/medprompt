## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation with a testicular mass that has not changed since it was first noticed, and given its firm nature and non-reducible nature on physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is a non-cancerous (benign) tumor. The negative transillumination test further supports this, as benign masses typically do not allow light to pass through.

The best next step in management for a patient with a testicular mass that meets these criteria would be to obtain imaging evidence of the mass to confirm its nature and assess for any potential complications or metastasis. Among the options provided:

- Needle biopsy (A) is an invasive procedure that involves taking tissue samples from the mass, which may not provide sufficient information about the tumor's nature.
- Testicular ultrasound (B) is a non-invasive imaging test that can provide detailed images of the testicle and surrounding structures, allowing for the assessment of the mass's size, shape, and relationship to surrounding tissues. It can also help differentiate between solid and cystic masses.
- CT abdomen and pelvis (C) may be useful in evaluating potential metastatic disease or complications such as torsion or rupture, but it is not typically the first step in evaluating a testicular mass that has been present for an unknown duration.
- Send labs (D) may be necessary if there are concerns about the patient's overall health or if the ultrasound findings suggest a need for further evaluation of the tumor's potential impact on hormone levels or other endocrine functions.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a testicular ultrasound to evaluate the mass and obtain more detailed information about its nature.
