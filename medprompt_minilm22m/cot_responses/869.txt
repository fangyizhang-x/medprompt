## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's recent memory impairment, difficulty with daily functioning (e.g., paying bills and going shopping), and history of living alone since his wife's death, along with his emotional state (feeling 'down' most days and having a flat affect), we can evaluate each option as follows:

A. Pseudodementia: This condition is characterized by cognitive decline without significant structural brain changes on imaging studies. However, the patient's recent memory impairment and difficulty with daily functioning are not typical features of pseudodementia.

B. Dementia: Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. The patient's symptoms, including memory impairment, difficulty with daily tasks, emotional changes (feeling 'down'), and a flat affect, suggest that he may be experiencing cognitive decline. However, dementia typically involves more pronounced impairments in multiple domains of functioning.

C. Delirium: Delirium is characterized by an acute onset of fluctuating cognitive impairment, often accompanied by confusion, disorientation, and altered level of consciousness. The patient's recent memory impairment, difficulty with daily tasks, and emotional changes (feeling 'down') are not typical features of delirium.

D. Pick’s disease: This is a type of frontotemporal dementia characterized by progressive damage to the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, leading to personality changes, cognitive decline, and motor dysfunction. The patient's history of living alone since his wife's death, difficulty with daily tasks (e.g., paying bills), emotional changes (feeling 'down'), and a flat affect are all consistent with Pick’s disease.

Considering these factors, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Pick’s disease, given his recent memory impairment, difficulty with daily functioning, emotional changes, and a history of living alone since his wife's death.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
