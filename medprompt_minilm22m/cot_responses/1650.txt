(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Firstly, let's understand the mechanism of action of cilostazol. It inhibits phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3), which is an enzyme that breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in vascular smooth muscle cells. By inhibiting PDE3, cilostazol increases cAMP levels, leading to relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle and vasodilation.

Given this mechanism, we can expect another effect of cilostazol by considering its effects on other physiological processes:

- Increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume (A) is not a direct consequence of increasing cAMP levels in vascular smooth muscle cells. While increased cAMP could potentially affect cardiac function, it's not the most direct or expected outcome.
  
- Positive inotropy (B) refers to an increase in contractility of the heart muscle. This is indeed a potential effect of cilostazol, as increased cAMP can lead to enhanced contraction force of the heart muscle.

- Angioedema (C) is a rare but serious allergic reaction that involves swelling of the skin and mucous membranes. It's not directly related to the mechanism of action of cilostazol.

- Antiarrhythmic action (D) refers to the ability of a drug to prevent or treat irregular heartbeats. While some phosphodiesterase inhibitors, including PDE3 inhibitors like cilostazol, have been used in certain cardiac conditions, their primary use is not as antiarrhythmics.

Considering these points, the most direct and expected effect of cilostazol's mechanism of action would be positive inotropy, as increased cAMP levels can enhance contractility of the heart muscle.
