To determine the mechanism of action of sofosbuvir, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Understanding Sofosbuvir**: Sofosbuvir is an antiviral medication used to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

2. **Mechanism of Action**: The primary mechanism of action for most direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), including sofosbuvir, involves inhibiting a specific step in the viral replication process.

3. **Reverse Transcription Inhibitors (RTIs)**: RTIs work by blocking the reverse transcription step of the viral life cycle. This is where the virus converts its RNA into DNA, which can then be integrated into the host cell's genome. The most common RTI for HCV is tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

4. **Sofosbuvirâ€™s Mechanism**: Sofosbuvir specifically targets the NS5B protein of the hepatitis C virus. It does this by inhibiting the NS5B polymerase, which is necessary for viral DNA synthesis and replication. This action prevents the production of new viral particles from infected cells.

5. **Comparison with Other Options**:
   - A: Inhibits DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. While some antivirals may target DNA-dependent enzymes, this is not the primary mechanism of action for sofosbuvir.
   - B: Inhibits reverse transcriptase. This is the mechanism of action for tenofovir and other RTIs like velpatasvir and daclatasvir but not for sofosbuvir.
   - C: Inhibits integrase. Integrase inhibitors, such as entecavir and lamivudine, target the viral integrase enzyme necessary for viral DNA integration into the host genome. This is not how sofosbuvir works.
   - D: Inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Sofosbuvir does not work by inhibiting this step; it targets a different aspect of the viral replication process.

Therefore, based on the mechanism of action for sofosbuvir and its role in treating HCV infection, the correct answer is:

The mechanism of action of sofosbuvir is inhibiting synthesis of DNA-dependent DNA polymerase.
