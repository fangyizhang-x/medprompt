## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The key points from this scenario are:

1. The patient has a history of right salpingo-oophorectomy, which suggests she may have had adhesions in the abdominal cavity.
2. The patient presents with severe right lower quadrant tenderness and rebound tenderness, indicating an inflamed appendix.
3. The laboratory studies show leukocytosis with left shift, suggesting a possible infection or inflammatory process.
4. The abdominal CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis.

Given these points, let's consider the options:

A. Teniae coli - These are part of the peritoneal ligaments that attach the rectum to the posterior wall of the abdomen. While they can be involved in adhesions, they are not typically used as a guide for locating an appendix during surgery.

B. Ileocolic artery - This is a branch of the superior mesenteric artery that supplies blood to the ileum (part of the small intestine). It is not directly related to the location or identification of the appendix.

C. Right ureter - The right ureter is a structure that runs along the posterior wall of the abdomen and can be involved in adhesions, but it is not typically used as a guide for locating an appendix during surgery.

D. Epiploic appendages (also known as the greater omentum) - This is a fold of peritoneal tissue that contains the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile ducts. The epiploic foramen is located between the free edge of the lesser omentum and the first part of the duodenum. During an appendectomy, surgeons often use the epiploic foramen as a guide to locate the appendix.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the attending physician is most likely referring to the epiploic foramen or structures within it as a guide for locating the appendix during surgery.
