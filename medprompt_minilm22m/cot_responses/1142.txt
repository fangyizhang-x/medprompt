## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's understand the genetic basis of Cystic Fibrosis (CF). It is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disease. Carriers, who are heterozygous for the mutation (have one normal and one mutated allele), typically do not show symptoms but can pass the mutated allele to their offspring.

Given that both parents are carriers of the same CF mutation, we need to calculate the probability of at least one child having CF in three generations. To simplify this, let's first consider the probability of a single child having CF and then multiply it by the number of children (3).

1. The probability of a parent being a carrier is 50% or 0.5 (since they are heterozygous for the mutation).
2. The probability of a child inheriting two normal alleles (not carrying the mutated gene) from each parent is 25% or 0.25 (50% chance of not being a carrier x 50% chance of not being affected by CF).
3. Therefore, the probability of a single child having no CF and being a carrier is 0.25.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities for three generations:

- **Generation 1:** Both parents are carriers (0.5 each). The probability that their single child has no CF and is not a carrier is 0.25.
- **Generation 2:** Their children inherit the 0.25 probability of having no CF from their parent, so all three children have no CF and are not carriers. This means there's only one child who doesn't carry the mutated gene (the other two being carriers).
- **Generation 3:** The single child from Generation 1 is a carrier (0.5). Their child inherits this carrier status from them, making it certain that their child will be a carrier and not have CF.

Given these probabilities, we can see that in three generations, the probability of at least one child having CF is actually 100% because all children will inherit the mutated gene from one parent who is a carrier. This means there's no chance of none or only one child having CF.

Therefore, the answer is A. 0.
