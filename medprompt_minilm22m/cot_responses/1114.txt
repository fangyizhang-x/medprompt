## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To answer this question, let's analyze the effects of atorvastatin and cholestyramine on lipid metabolism.

1. **Atorvastatin**: This is a statin, a class of drugs that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme playing a central role in cholesterol production in the liver. By reducing the rate of cholesterol synthesis, atorvastatin decreases the amount of LDL (bad) cholesterol produced.

2. **Cholestyramine**: This is a bile acid sequestrant that works by binding to bile acids in the gut and removing them from the body. Bile acids are necessary for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin A and D. By reducing the amount of bile acids available for these processes, cholestyramine increases the levels of cholesterol in the blood.

Given that both atorvastatin and cholestyramine work on different aspects of lipid metabolism:

- Atorvastatin reduces LDL cholesterol production.
- Cholestyramine increases the level of cholesterol in the blood by reducing its absorption from the gut.

Therefore, when considering their combined effects, we can expect that both agents would increase the levels of **cholesterol** in the blood. This is because atorvastatin decreases the amount of LDL cholesterol produced and cholestyramine increases the level of cholesterol available for absorption into the bloodstream.

The other options are incorrect because:

- A. Lipoprotein lipase activity is involved in the breakdown of triglycerides, not directly related to the effects of atorvastatin and cholestyramine.
- B. LDL receptor expression would be decreased by atorvastatin, not increased.
- D. Hepatic de novo cholesterol synthesis is actually reduced by statins like atorvastatin, as they inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase.

The final answer is: A
