## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history of a traumatic brain injury (TBI) with symptoms such as persistent headache, trouble focusing, confusion, vertigo, and memory issues, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of his TBI on his cognitive function and overall health.

Firstly, the patient's recent head CT scan was normal, which suggests that there may not be an acute hemorrhage or other obvious cause for his symptoms. However, this does not rule out the possibility of chronic effects from the injury, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is a known complication of TBI.

Considering the patient's symptoms, particularly the memory issues and vertigo, it is plausible that he may be experiencing some form of cognitive or vestibular dysfunction. This could be related to his TBI or another underlying condition.

Option A, a CT scan of the head without contrast, is not necessary at this point as there is no indication of an acute hemorrhage or other obvious cause for the patient's symptoms. Option B, fluoxetine, is an antidepressant that may be prescribed if the patient has depression, but it does not address the potential cognitive or vestibular issues related to his TBI.

Option C, rest and primary care follow up, is not sufficient as a next step in management. While rest and observation are important for some patients with TBI, they do not provide any diagnostic information or treatment for the patient's symptoms.

Option D, thiamine, may be beneficial for patients with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is a known complication of TBI. However, it is essential to note that CTE can take years to develop after the initial injury, and thiamine supplementation alone may not be sufficient to prevent or treat its symptoms.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms and history, the best next step in management would be to order further imaging studies, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with contrast, to evaluate for any potential chronic effects from his TBI. This will help determine if CTE is present and guide further treatment decisions.

The final answer is: A
