## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To address this question, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Change in Behavior Over Time**: The boy has been exhibiting a significant change in behavior over 2 months, from being suspended for bullying and aggressive behavior to smoking cigarettes in his backyard. This rapid shift suggests that there might be an underlying psychological issue driving these changes.

2. **Past Behavior and Grades**: His consistent high grades and regular attendance at church events suggest that he was functioning well academically and socially before the recent changes.

3. **Recent Life Events**: The discovery of his father moving out, coupled with his wife's affair, could be significant stressors contributing to the boy's behavior change. However, these events alone do not directly explain the shift in behavior from academic success to negative actions.

4. **Behavioral Changes and Defense Mechanisms**:
   - **A. Acting Out**: This defense mechanism involves acting out unacceptable impulses or behaviors as a way of expressing emotions. While it could be a factor for some individuals, it doesn't fully account for the boy's overall change in behavior.
   - **B. Projection**: This is when an individual attributes their unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else. It doesn't directly explain the boy's behavior change.
   - **C. Passive Aggression**: This involves expressing negative emotions indirectly through actions, such as giving the silent treatment or making sarcastic comments. While it could be a part of his behavior, it might not fully capture the complexity of his recent changes.
   - **D. Regression**: This defense mechanism involves reverting to earlier behaviors or attitudes due to stress, anxiety, or other psychological factors. Given that the boy has been suspended multiple times for similar reasons and exhibits significant behavioral changes over a short period, regression seems like the most plausible explanation.

Considering these points, the boy's recent behavior change, particularly his repeated instances of bullying, aggressive behavior, smoking cigarettes in his backyard, and being expelled from school, suggests that he is experiencing stress related to the recent life events. Regression best explains this situation as it accounts for the boy's return to earlier behaviors or attitudes due to the significant stressors present.

The final answer is: $\boxed{D}$
