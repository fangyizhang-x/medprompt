Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, the primary concern is to manage her acute respiratory illness while also considering her concerns about vaccination.

Firstly, the patient presents with fever, chills, headache, dry cough, malaise, and generalized muscle aches. These symptoms are consistent with an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), which is a common cause of influenza-like illnesses in this age group.

The patient's history of intermittent asthma and her decision not to receive the influenza vaccine due to concerns about side effects also warrant consideration. However, given that she has recently been exposed to influenza, it is likely that she will develop symptoms of the disease.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate next step in management would be to provide supportive therapy to alleviate her symptoms and manage any potential complications. This includes:

- Providing analgesia for pain and discomfort
- Addressing her respiratory symptoms with bronchodilators (if necessary) or other medications as prescribed by her physician

The options provided can be evaluated as follows:

A. Supportive therapy only - While supportive therapy is essential, it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's illness.

B. Amantadine - This medication is used to treat influenza A and may have some benefit in reducing the severity of symptoms. However, it is not a first-line treatment for acute URTI.

C. Inactivated influenza vaccine - Given that the patient has recently been exposed to influenza, vaccination would be an appropriate next step to prevent future illness. The inactivated vaccine is recommended for individuals who are at high risk of severe disease or have certain underlying health conditions.

D. Oseltamivir - This antiviral medication is used to treat and prevent influenza A and B. However, it is not typically prescribed as a first-line treatment for acute URTI due to concerns about its effectiveness in preventing symptoms in the early stages of illness.

Therefore, considering the patient's recent exposure to influenza and her decision not to receive the vaccine, the most appropriate next step in management would be to provide supportive therapy only.
