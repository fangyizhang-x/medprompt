Given the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, let's analyze the information step by step to arrive at the most likely diagnosis.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 17-year-old boy who had persistent bleeding from his wisdom teeth during surgery. He also has easy bruising and joint swelling in the family history. These symptoms suggest a coagulopathy, which could be related to an inherited disorder affecting platelet function or blood clotting.

2. **Family History**: The mother's brother had similar problems with bleeding and joint swelling after his wisdom teeth were removed. This suggests a possible genetic component to the condition.

3. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - **Hematocrit 35%**: Indicates anemia, which can be associated with various conditions including coagulopathies.
   - **Leukocyte count 8,500/mm^3**: Within normal limits, but this does not specifically point towards a particular diagnosis.
   - **Platelet count 160,000/mm^3**: This is significantly low (thrombocytopenia), which can lead to bleeding complications. The platelets are also normal-sized, which might suggest that the issue lies in the platelet function rather than their morphology.
   - **Prothrombin time (PT) and Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)**: Both are prolonged (15 sec and 60 sec respectively), indicating a problem with blood clotting. The PTT is more specific for intrinsic pathway issues, while PT is more related to extrinsic and common pathways.
   - **Bleeding Time**: Normal, which suggests that the primary issue might not be with the platelet function itself but rather with the coagulation cascade.

4. **Serum Tests**:
   - **Urea nitrogen 20 mg/dL and Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL**: Slightly elevated, indicating mild renal impairment.
   - **Bilirubin Total 1.0 mg/dL and Direct 0.5 mg/dL**: Normal levels, suggesting no liver dysfunction.

5. **Peripheral Blood Smear**: Shows normal-sized platelets, which is important as it helps to rule out conditions that typically present with abnormal platelet morphology (e.g., Bernard-Soulier syndrome).

Given these findings:

- **Glanzmann Thrombasthenia** is a rare bleeding disorder characterized by
