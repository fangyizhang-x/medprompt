## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, let's identify the key elements of the question:

1. The type of synaptic transmission is a chemical synapse.
2. Increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels trigger the release of neurotransmitters from small vesicles with dense cores.

Based on this information, we can infer that the neurotransmitter involved in this type of synaptic transmission is likely to be one that is released into the synaptic cleft and has properties similar to those of glutamate.

Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). It acts by binding to glutamate receptors, which are ionotropic receptors that allow ions to flow through the cell membrane. This influx of ions can trigger an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron.

Given this background, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a peptide hormone involved in reproductive processes and has no known role as a neurotransmitter.

B. Epinephrine is a catecholamine neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the body's "fight or flight" response, but it is not typically released into the synaptic cleft in small vesicles with dense cores.

C. GABA (Î³-amino butyric acid) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that acts by binding to GABA receptors, which are ligand-gated chloride channels. While GABA can be released from small vesicles, it is not typically associated with the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft in this manner.

D. Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter that fits the description provided in the question.

Therefore, based on our analysis, the most likely neurotransmitter to be released into the synaptic cleft in this type of synapse is glutamate.
