Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE), a chronic autoimmune skin condition characterized by a recurring rash that typically affects the face and sometimes other areas. The presence of nonpainful ulcers on the roof of the mouth further supports this diagnosis.

The patient's inconsistent condom use increases her risk for sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Given her mother's end-stage renal disease, it is essential to consider the possibility of HIV infection and its implications for her health.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a skin biopsy. A skin biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis of DLE by demonstrating characteristic histopathological features such as perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, granulomatous inflammation, and epidermal edema. This information will guide further treatment decisions, including the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy.

In contrast, a renal biopsy (B) may be considered if there is suspicion of an underlying renal condition, but given the patient's normal serum creatinine levels and negative urine protein and RBC casts, this is not immediately indicated. Administration of azathioprine (C) would be premature without further diagnostic confirmation of DLE. Pathergy skin testing (D) is a test for contact dermatitis and is not relevant to this patient's presentation.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of DLE and guide subsequent treatment decisions.
