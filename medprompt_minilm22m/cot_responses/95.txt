## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can analyze the possible causes step by step:

1. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Background**: The patient has a history of SLE, which is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the kidneys. However, in this case, her symptoms are more localized to her legs.

2. **Recent Travel and Weight Gain**: The patient recently returned from Brazil, where she spent most of her time on foot, and gained weight during her vacation. This could be relevant because it may indicate a possible cause related to her recent travel or lifestyle changes.

3. **Physical Examination Findings**:
   - 2+ pretibial edema bilaterally: Edema in the lower legs is often associated with kidney problems.
   - Urinalysis shows blood, protein, and RBC casts: These findings indicate renal involvement.
   - WBCs are present but rare: This suggests that the inflammation is not as severe as it could be.

4. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - Given the patient's SLE history and recent travel to Brazil, a possible cause related to her travel or lifestyle changes needs to be considered.
   - Venous insufficiency (A) might explain some of the findings but does not fully account for the renal involvement.
   - Lymphatic obstruction (B) could also contribute to edema but is less likely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.
   - Renal protein loss (C) would be more consistent with a nephrotic syndrome, which is not indicated by the presence of RBC casts or significant hematuria.
   - Salt retention (D) can lead to edema and renal impairment but does not directly explain the patient's symptoms.

5. **Conclusion**: Considering the patient's SLE history, recent travel, weight gain, and physical examination findings, the most likely cause of her leg findings is lymphatic obstruction. This could be related to a condition such as lymphedema, which can occur in patients with SLE due to lymph node involvement or other factors.

Therefore, the answer is D.
