## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation and treatment, we can deduce that she is experiencing preeclampsia, a condition characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine during pregnancy.

The patient has been started on magnesium sulfate for its neuroprotective effects (e.g., preventing seizures) and diazepam for its sedative properties. The medication affecting both α- and β-adrenergic receptors is likely to be used to manage hypertension, which is a key component of preeclampsia.

The most appropriate medication that affects both α- and β-adrenergic receptors and is commonly used in the management of hypertension during pregnancy is metoprolol succinate. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that has been shown to reduce blood pressure and improve outcomes in patients with preeclampsia.

Metoprolol's mechanism of action involves blocking both α- and β-adrenergic receptors, which can help to:

1. Reduce peripheral resistance
2. Decrease cardiac output
3. Lower blood pressure

Additionally, metoprolol has been shown to have a beneficial effect on fetal well-being in patients with preeclampsia.

The other options are not as directly related to the management of hypertension and proteinuria in preeclampsia:

- Labetalol is a mixed alpha/beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, which may be used in certain cases but is not typically the first choice for managing hypertension in preeclampsia.
- Esmolol is a selective β1-receptor blocker with a short half-life, often used for acute blood pressure control. While it can be used to manage hypertension, its use in preeclampsia is less common compared to metoprolol.
- Pindolol is a non-selective adrenergic receptor antagonist that may not be the best choice for managing hypertension in preeclampsia.

Therefore, based on the patient's presentation and treatment, the most consistent medication with this mechanism of action is metoprolol succinate.
