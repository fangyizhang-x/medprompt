## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation of a 7-month-old boy with pallor, abdominal distention, hepatosplenomegaly, frontal skull bossing, and markedly increased HbF and HbA2 levels on hemoglobin electrophoresis, we can deduce that this patient likely has sickle cell disease (SCD).

Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the HBB gene that codes for the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin. This mutation leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS), which polymerizes under low oxygen conditions, causing red blood cells to become sickle-shaped.

The increased levels of HbF and HbA2 in this patient's serum are also consistent with sickle cell disease. HbF is a fetal form of hemoglobin that is produced during fetal development, while HbA2 is a minor adult hemoglobin that is present in smaller amounts than HbA.

The peripheral blood smear findings for SCD typically include:

- Basophilic stippling of erythrocytes: This refers to the presence of small, dark-staining inclusions within the red blood cells. These inclusions are caused by the accumulation of iron and other substances that can be released from damaged red blood cells.
- Microcytosis and hypochromasia of erythrocytes: Sickle cell disease often leads to microcytic (small) and hypochromic (reduced hemoglobin content) red blood cells, which are more prone to destruction and fragmentation.

In contrast, the other options are not consistent with sickle cell disease:

- Schistocytes and normocytic erythrocytes: Schistocytes are fragmented red blood cells that are typically seen in conditions such as thalassemia or mechanical heart valve disease.
- Sickling of erythrocytes: While sickling can occur in some cases of SCD, it is not a characteristic finding.

Therefore, the most likely findings on a peripheral blood smear for this patient with sickle cell disease would be basophilic stippling of erythrocytes and microcytosis with hypochromasia.
