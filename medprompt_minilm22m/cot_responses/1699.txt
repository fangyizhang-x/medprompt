## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of weakness and fatigue, along with significant peripheral edema, we need to consider conditions that can lead to fluid retention and cardiac dysfunction.

Firstly, let's evaluate each option in relation to the provided information:

A. Previous treatment with doxorubicin: Doxorubicin is a chemotherapy medication known for its cardiotoxic effects, which can lead to impaired diastolic relaxation and subsequent heart failure. However, it is not typically associated with peripheral edema as a primary symptom.

B. Hemochromatosis: This genetic disorder leads to excessive iron accumulation in the body, which can cause cardiac dysfunction due to iron overload. While hemochromatosis can lead to cardiomyopathy, it is less commonly associated with peripheral edema compared to other options.

C. History of myocardial infarction: A previous MI may have led to left ventricular hypertrophy and subsequent diastolic dysfunction, but the preserved ejection fraction in this patient suggests that the heart's pumping ability is not significantly impaired at this point.

D. History of a recent viral infection: Certain viral infections, such as hepatitis B or C, can cause chronic inflammation and fibrosis in the liver, leading to cirrhosis. This condition can result in portal hypertension, which causes fluid retention (peripheral edema) due to increased pressure in the hepatic veins.

Considering these factors, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a history of a recent viral infection, as it can lead to chronic inflammation and fibrosis that may have resulted in impaired diastolic relaxation and peripheral edema.

## Answer Choices:
A. Previous treatment with doxorubicin
B. Hemochromatosis
C. History of myocardial infarction
D. History of a recent viral infection

The final answer is: D
