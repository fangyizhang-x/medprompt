(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) following sexual intercourse, it is essential to consider the possibility of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The presence of WBCs and rare gram-positive cocci in the urinalysis suggests a possible bacterial infection.

The fact that the patient has had three similar episodes over the past year, which resolved with antibiotic treatment, raises concerns about the possibility of an STI. Additionally, her sexual activity without barrier contraception increases the risk of transmission to partners.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate recommendation to prevent similar episodes in the future is to treat the partner with intramuscular ceftriaxone, as this will help to eliminate any potential STIs and reduce the risk of transmission to other partners. This approach aligns with current guidelines for treating sexually transmitted infections, which emphasize the importance of partner screening and treatment.

The other options are not appropriate recommendations:

- Postcoital vaginal probiotics may provide some benefits in reducing symptoms of UTIs, but they do not address the underlying cause.
- Treatment of the partner with intramuscular ceftriaxone is a more targeted approach that addresses the potential STI, rather than just treating the patient's symptoms.
- Daily oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be used to treat UTIs caused by certain types of bacteria, but it does not address the possibility of an STI.

Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation is B. Treatment of the partner with intramuscular ceftriaxone.
