## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation:

1. **Hypertension**: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension, which is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
2. **Diabetes**: Although not explicitly stated as a concern, diabetes can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and may be related to his overall health status.
3. **Smoking history**: A pack-a-day smoking habit increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and heart failure.
4. **Physical exam findings**: The presence of a murmur best heard in the 5th intercostal space at the left mid-clavicular line is characteristic of mitral regurgitation (MR). The murmur's high-pitched, blowing character and its radiation to the axilla are also consistent with MR.
5. **Opening snap**: An opening snap is a characteristic feature of mitral stenosis, not MR.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. Presents with an opening snap - This is more characteristic of mitral stenosis, which is less likely given the patient's presentation.

B. Radiation of murmur to the axilla - While mitral regurgitation can cause a murmur that radiates to the axilla, this is not a defining feature of MR.

C. Radiation of murmur to the right sternal border - This is more characteristic of aortic regurgitation (AR), which typically causes a murmur that radiates to the right sternal border.

D. Results in mixing of blood between left and right ventricles - Mitral regurgitation can cause an increase in volume load on the left ventricle, leading to increased pressure and volume overload, which may result in mitral regurgitation. This condition is known as "mitral regurgitant volume overload" or "MRVO," where the left ventricle becomes overloaded due to the backflow of blood into it during systole.

Therefore, considering the patient's presentation and the characteristics of MR, the most likely disorder is mitral regurgitation (MRVO), which results in mixing of blood between the left and right ventricles.
