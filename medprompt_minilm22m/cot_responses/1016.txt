## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation, we can analyze the information step by step to determine the most likely cause of his symptoms.

1. **Timing and Nature of Symptoms**: The patient experienced an episode of unconsciousness followed by a normal response after regaining consciousness. This suggests that the episode was transient and not indicative of a severe cardiac event such as a myocardial infarction or severe heart failure.

2. **Past Medical History**: The patient has had episodes of mild chest pain and abdominal discomfort for the past 2 months, especially while working on his car. These symptoms are suggestive of angina pectoris, which is often associated with coronary artery disease (CAD).

3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The presence of a 3/6 late systolic murmur at the right sternal border that radiates to the carotids is highly suggestive of aortic regurgitation (AR). This finding is consistent with asymmetric septal hypertrophy, which is a common cause of AR.

4. **Hypertension and Treatment**: The patient's hypertension is well-controlled with hydrochlorothiazide, but it does not directly explain the murmur or the symptoms described.

5. **Neurological Examination**: There are no focal neurological findings, which suggests that the transient episode of unconsciousness was likely related to cardiac causes rather than central nervous system involvement.

Considering these points, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is asymmetric septal hypertrophy (B), which is a common cause of aortic regurgitation. This condition can lead to a murmur that radiates to the carotids and can also cause transient episodes of unconsciousness due to decreased cardiac output.

Therefore, the answer is B.
