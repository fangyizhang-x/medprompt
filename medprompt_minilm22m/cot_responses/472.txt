## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To address this question, let's break down the key points and analyze them step by step:

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 67-year-old man with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). This means he has a history of heart disease that is currently well-managed but may require adjustments to prevent future events.

2. **Current Medication**: He takes sublingual nitroglycerine tablets prior to jogging to manage angina symptoms. Nitroglycerine works by releasing nitric oxide, which relaxes vascular smooth muscle and reduces blood pressure, thereby reducing the workload on the heart.

3. **Goal**: The patient wants to increase his running distance without increasing the dose of sublingual nitroglycerine. This implies he is looking for a way to manage exertional chest pain during longer runs while maintaining stable coronary artery function.

4. **Potential Effects of Increasing Nitroglycerine Dose**:
    - **A. Rebound Angina**: Typically occurs when the body adapts to chronic use of nitroglycerine by increasing its clearance, reducing its effects over time.
    - **B. Reflex Sympathetic Activity**: This is a normal response to increased physical exertion and can be managed with rest, hydration, and possibly some anti-arrhythmic medication if necessary.
    - **C. Anaphylactic Reaction**: Nitroglycerine is an inhaled vasodilator; its use via sublingual tablets would not typically lead to systemic absorption or a severe allergic reaction.
    - **D. Coronary Artery Vasospasm**: This could be a concern if the patient's CAD worsens, but it's less directly related to nitroglycerine dosing and more about underlying coronary artery disease.

Given these considerations, increasing the dose of sublingual nitroglycerine would most likely result in **B. Reflex Sympathetic Activity**. This is because the body will adapt to chronic use by reducing its clearance of nitroglycerine, leading to increased effects over time and potentially causing chest pain during exertion.

The final answer is: B
