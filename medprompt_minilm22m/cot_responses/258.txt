Given the scenario, let's break down the key points:

1. **Patient Profile**: A 31-year-old G1P0 woman at 26 weeks gestation.
2. **Symptoms and History**: Denies any symptoms but was given a large dose of oral glucose (50 g) one week prior to the current evaluation, resulting in an elevated venous plasma glucose level (156 mg/dL) after 1 hour.

Considering these points:

- The patient's history suggests that she is at risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), as indicated by her symptoms and the timing of the oral glucose challenge test (OGCT).
- The OGCT is a screening tool used to detect gestational diabetes, but it may not accurately diagnose GDM in all cases. A more sensitive test, such as the 75-g OGCT or the 50-g OGTT with insulin stimulation, would be preferred for diagnosis.

Given these considerations:

**Option B (Administer an oral, 3-hour 100 g glucose dose)** is the most appropriate next step in management. This option aligns with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines for diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus, which recommend a 3-hour 100-g glucose tolerance test after a positive OGCT or symptoms suggestive of GDM.

**Option A (Repeat the 50 g oral glucose challenge)** is not recommended as it may lead to false reassessment of the patient's status and does not provide additional diagnostic information.

**Option C (Advise the patient to follow an American Diabetic Association diet plan)** is not appropriate, as this approach may delay diagnosis and treatment of gestational diabetes. A more effective strategy would be to educate the patient on how to manage her condition through lifestyle modifications and monitoring.

**Option D (Begin insulin treatment)** should only be considered after a definitive diagnosis of GDM has been established through a more sensitive test or clinical evaluation, not as an initial step in management.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer an oral glucose tolerance test with a 3-hour 100-g glucose dose to confirm the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus.
