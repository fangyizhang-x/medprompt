## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine the tRNA anticodon for the last amino acid translated in the chain, we need to consider the base pairing rules between mRNA and tRNA.

In this case, since translation starts at the first base (5'), we can analyze the sequence from right to left:

- The first base is C.
- The second base is G.
- The third base is A.
- The fourth base is U.
- The fifth base is A.
- The sixth base is U.
- The seventh base is A.
- The eighth base is U.
- The ninth base is A.
- The tenth base is C.

The anticodon of tRNA is complementary to the codon on the mRNA. Since we are looking for the last amino acid, which is encoded by the codon "AUA", we need to find the corresponding anticodon that pairs with this codon.

From the sequence, we can see that the anticodons for the first 9 bases (C-G-A-U-A-U-A-C) pair with the following codons on the mRNA:

- C: 5'
- G: 3'
- A: 1' (since it's the first base)
- U: 2' (since it's the second base)
- A: 4' (since it's the third base)
- U: 6' (since it's the fourth base)
- A: 8' (since it's the fifth base)
- U: 10' (since it's the sixth base)
- A: 12' (since it's the seventh base)
- C: 14' (since it's the eighth base)

Therefore, the tRNA anticodon for the last amino acid translated in the chain is 3' GAU.

The final answer is B.
