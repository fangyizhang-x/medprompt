## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's consider the physiological response to aspirin overdose and its effects on acid-base balance.

1. **Aspirin overdose** is a classic cause of salicylate toxicity, which can lead to metabolic acidosis.
2. **Metabolic acidosis** occurs when there is an increase in the concentration of acidic substances (such as lactate or non-anion gap metabolic acidosis) in the blood.
3. The body's initial response to aspirin overdose involves the inhibition of salicylate reuptake by the liver, leading to a buildup of salicylates in the bloodstream.
4. Aspirin is an **weak organic acid**, and its metabolites are weak organic acids (salicylic acid). When these weak acids accumulate in the body, they can lead to a decrease in bicarbonate production by the kidneys.
5. The decreased bicarbonate production results in a decrease in the excretion of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAMDA) and an increase in the concentration of acidic substances in the blood.
6. As a result, the **non-anion gap metabolic acidosis** will be the first to occur.

Therefore, considering the physiological response to aspirin overdose, the correct answer is:

## Answer
Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
