## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's symptoms and history, we can deduce that he likely has post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), a condition characterized by an immune complex-mediated inflammatory response in the kidneys. The presence of a generalized, diffuse maculopapular rash is consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient's recent initiation of hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension and his current symptoms of flank pain, blood-tinged urine, and elevated creatinine concentration are also suggestive of PSGN. The fact that he takes acetaminophen for back pain does not directly relate to the renal findings but is consistent with a non-specific cause of flank pain.

The absence of abnormalities on renal ultrasonography rules out other causes of kidney disease, such as pyelonephritis or structural abnormalities like stones.

Now, let's consider the options:

A. Dermal IgA deposition on skin biopsy - This finding is characteristic of dermatomyositis, a condition that can cause rash and muscle weakness. However, it is not directly related to PSGN.

B. Crescent-shape extracapillary cell proliferation - This finding is indicative of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), which is characterized by severe kidney damage and rapid loss of renal function. While RPGN can occur in the context of PSGN, it is not the most likely finding given the patient's current symptoms.

C. Mesangial IgA deposits on renal biopsy - This finding is characteristic of IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease), a common cause of kidney disease worldwide. However, IgA nephropathy typically presents with hematuria rather than flank pain and elevated creatinine levels.

D. Urinary eosinophils - Eosinophilia in the urine can be seen in various conditions, including PSGN. The presence of urinary eosinophils is a specific finding that supports this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, history, and laboratory findings, the most likely finding to be observed in this patient is urinary eosinophils.
