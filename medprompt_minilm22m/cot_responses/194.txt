## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The clinical presentation of this 2-year-old boy, including fever, jerky movements (myoclonic seizures), gradual loss of speech, vision, and motor skills, as well as the physical examination findings of hypertonicity, pallor of the optic disc, brain atrophy, and hyperintensity on MRI, strongly suggest a diagnosis of Krabbe disease.

Krabbe disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme galactocerebrosidase (GALC). This enzyme is necessary for breaking down certain fatty substances called galactocerebroside in the brain. Without sufficient GALC, these substances accumulate and cause damage to the brain.

The histopathologic examination of the brain showing aggregation of globoid cells and loss of glial cells further supports this diagnosis. Globoid cells are a type of abnormal cell that accumulates in the brain due to the lack of galactocerebrosidase activity, leading to neuronal degeneration.

Therefore, considering the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and biochemical evidence of enzyme deficiency, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a deficiency of the enzyme Î²-Galactocerebrosidase (D).
