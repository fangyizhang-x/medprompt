## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the patient's presentation of abdominal distension, undulating pain, nausea, vomiting, and mild eosinophilia, along with the CT scan findings of multiple small eggshell calcifications within the right lobe of the liver, we can consider several potential etiologies for his symptoms.

Firstly, the presence of eggshell calcifications in the liver is highly suggestive of a parasitic infection. Among the options provided, Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) is known to cause cysticercosis, which can lead to calcification within organs such as the liver. This condition is often asymptomatic until late stages and may present with abdominal distension, pain, and other systemic symptoms.

Echinococcus granulosus (A) is a common cause of cystic echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, which can lead to calcification in organs like the liver. However, this condition typically presents with more pronounced symptoms such as coughing up blood or abdominal pain, and imaging findings may include larger cysts rather than eggshell calcifications.

Enterobius vermicularis (B) is a pinworm infection that primarily causes perianal itching and can lead to intestinal obstruction if the worms migrate into the bowel. While it can cause abdominal distension due to gas and fluid accumulation, it is not typically associated with eggshell calcifications in the liver.

Necator americanus (C) is another type of hookworm that can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and weight loss. However, it is less commonly associated with calcification within organs like the liver compared to Taenia solium.

Given the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely etiology of his symptoms is Taenia solium (D), which is a parasitic infection that can cause cysticercosis leading to eggshell calcifications in the liver.

Therefore, the answer is D.
