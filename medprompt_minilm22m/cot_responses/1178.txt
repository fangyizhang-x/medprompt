## Step 1: Define the terms and understand the context
The question involves a genetic population study to determine the penetrance of a disease associated with impaired iron metabolism, which primarily affects the liver. The disease is linked to diabetes and bronze skin pigmentation. A genetic screening was conducted on 120 inhabitants with a family history of this disease, resulting in 40 patients having the disease-producing genotype but only 10 presenting symptoms.

## Step 2: Identify the key concepts
- **Penetrance**: The proportion of individuals with a particular genotype who will express the associated phenotype (in this case, the disease).
- **Genotype and Phenotype Relationship**: The relationship between an individual's genetic makeup and their likelihood of developing a specific condition or trait.

## Step 3: Analyze the data
From the given information:
- 40 out of 120 individuals with the disease-producing genotype developed symptoms.
- This implies that 60% of those with the genotype did not develop symptoms, suggesting some level of non-penetrance.

## Step 4: Estimate the penetrance
Given that 10 out of 40 patients with the genotype developed symptoms, we can estimate the penetrance. The formula for penetrance is:
\[ P(\text{phenotype} | \text{genotype}) = \frac{\text{Number of individuals with phenotype and genotype}}{\text{Total number of individuals with genotype}} \]
Plugging in the numbers gives us:
\[ P(\text{symptoms} | \text{genotype}) = \frac{10}{40} = 0.25 \]

## Step 5: Calculate the probability
To find the probability that a patient with the disease-producing genotype will develop symptoms, we use the estimated penetrance (0.25) and the total number of individuals with the genotype (40).

\[ P(\text{symptoms}) = P(\text{phenotype} | \text{genotype}) \times P(\text{genotype}) \]
Given that the probability of having the disease-producing genotype is assumed to be 0.25 (or 25%) based on the family history and the fact that only 10 out of 40 developed symptoms, we can calculate:
\[ P(\text{symptoms}) = 0.25 \times 0.4 = 0.1 \]

## Step 6: Convert to percentage
To express the probability as a percentage, multiply
