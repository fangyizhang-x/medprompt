## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To approach this question, let's consider the key points provided:

1. **Generalized tonic-clonic seizures**: This type of seizure involves both sides of the brain and can cause loss of consciousness, convulsions, and muscle stiffness.
2. **No prior history of seizures**: This suggests that the current episode might be a one-time event or an acute condition rather than a chronic condition like epilepsy.
3. **Asthma medication use**: The patient is taking daily asthma medication, which could potentially have some side effects.

Given these points, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **Albuterol**: This is a bronchodilator used to treat asthma symptoms. While it can cause muscle weakness and fatigue in rare cases, there's no direct association with seizures.

B. **Cromolyn**: This is an anti-inflammatory medication primarily used to prevent allergic reactions. It has not been commonly associated with seizures.

C. **Theophylline**: This is a methylxanthine drug used for asthma treatment and COPD management. Theophylline can have various side effects, including tremors, but it's not typically linked directly to seizures.

D. **Prednisone**: This is a corticosteroid used to treat inflammation and swelling in conditions like asthma. Corticosteroids are well-known to cause seizures as a rare side effect due to their impact on the brain's neurotransmitter systems.

Considering these points, the most likely answer associated with generalized tonic-clonic seizures in this patient is prednisone, given its known association with seizure activity.

## Answer
Therefore, the answer is D.
