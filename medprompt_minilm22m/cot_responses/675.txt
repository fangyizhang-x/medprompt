## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

### Initial Assessment:
The newborn presents with red eyes, discharge, eyelid swelling, and mucopurulent discharge in both eyes. The examination also reveals pink skin without any congenital anomalies noted.

### Key Findings:

- Red eyes: Suggests an infectious or inflammatory process.
- Discharge: Indicates a possible bacterial infection.
- Eyelid swelling: Can be associated with various conditions but, combined with the other symptoms, points towards an infectious or inflammatory process affecting the eye.
- Pink skin: Normal in this context.

### Diagnostic Findings:

- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of conjunctival scraping confirms the diagnosis as herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection.

### Management Considerations:

1. **Antiviral Treatment**: Given the confirmed diagnosis of HSV, antiviral treatment is essential to prevent complications and reduce the risk of transmission to others.
2. **Prolonged Antibiotic Therapy**: Since HSV can cause severe ocular disease, including corneal ulcers and vision loss if not treated promptly, antibiotic therapy is necessary to cover for potential bacterial involvement.

### Options Evaluation:

A. Reassurance and follow-up in 1 week: This option does not address the confirmed diagnosis of HSV infection or the need for antiviral treatment.
B. Intravenous acyclovir administration: This is the most appropriate next step as it directly addresses the confirmed diagnosis of HSV infection with antiviral therapy, which is crucial for preventing complications and reducing transmission risk.
C. Oral doxycycline administration: Doxycycline can be used to treat ocular herpes simplex but is not typically the first-line treatment due to its potential side effects and the availability of more effective antivirals like acyclovir.
D. Oral erythromycin administration: Erythromycin is an antibiotic that may be considered in cases where there's suspicion of bacterial involvement, but it does not address the confirmed HSV infection.

### Conclusion:
Given the diagnosis of HSV and the need for prompt treatment to prevent complications and reduce transmission risk, intravenous acyclovir administration is the most appropriate next step in management.
