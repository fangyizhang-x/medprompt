Given the patient's age, symptoms, and family history, we can narrow down the possible diagnoses.

Firstly, the fact that the rash has been present for several weeks suggests a chronic condition rather than an acute infection. This is consistent with atopic dermatitis (A), which typically starts in childhood but can persist into adulthood.

The presence of erythematous patches on the scalp, forehead, and along the hairline, especially when it is cold, is characteristic of seborrheic dermatitis (D). The greasy yellow scales are also consistent with this diagnosis. Atopic dermatitis typically presents with dry, scaly skin that may be more prone to cracking.

Seborrheic keratosis (B) is a benign condition characterized by small, rough patches on the skin, but it does not typically present with erythematous patches or greasy yellow scales. Seborrheic dermatitis, on the other hand, often presents with cradle cap-like lesions in infants and can become more widespread as the child grows older.

Allergic contact dermatitis (C) is an immune-mediated reaction to a specific allergen that typically presents with itchy, blistering skin rashes. While possible, this diagnosis seems less likely given the patient's age and lack of mention of any allergic symptoms or reactions.

Therefore, based on the patient's age, symptoms, and family history, the most likely diagnosis is seborrheic dermatitis (D).
