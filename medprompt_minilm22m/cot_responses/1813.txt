## Answer
(model generated chain of thought explanation)

Given the clinical presentation and imaging findings, we can deduce that this patient likely has a ureteral stone causing obstruction. The presence of mild dilation of the right ureter with multiple small stones is consistent with a ureteral stone.

The urinalysis finding most likely to appear in this patient's urine is related to the effects of the obstruction caused by the stone on the kidneys and urinary tract.

## Step 1: Understanding the effect of ureteral obstruction
Ureteral obstruction can lead to an increase in the concentration of the urine, which results in a low specific gravity. This is because the kidneys are trying to concentrate the urine to eliminate the excess fluid from the body due to the obstruction.

## Step 2: Considering the effects on kidney function
The patient's history of gout and hypertension may suggest that she has an underlying issue with kidney function, but this information is not directly relevant to the urinalysis finding in question A. However, it's worth noting that patients with kidney stones are more likely to have other kidney issues.

## Step 3: Analyzing the effect on urine pH
The presence of multiple small stones in the ureter can lead to an alkaline urine due to the increased concentration of calcium and magnesium ions from the stone fragments. This is because these ions can increase the pH of the urine, making it more alkaline.

## Step 4: Eliminating incorrect options
Options B (Alkaline urine) and D (Acidic urine) are less likely in this scenario. While some kidney stones may produce acidic urine, the presence of multiple small stones suggests that the overall effect on urine pH is more likely to be alkaline.

## Step 5: Selecting the most likely finding
Based on the analysis above, the most likely finding in the urinalysis of this patient is a low specific gravity due to the concentration of the urine as a result of ureteral obstruction. Option A (Low specific gravity) is therefore the correct answer.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$
