The burning sensation upon urination could be indicative of a UTI, which is often caused by bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli).\n\nThe patient's worsening symptoms despite increased fluid intake and cranberry extract consumption suggest that the infection may not be responding to these measures alone. Additionally, the absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and the gravid uterus on physical examination help to narrow down the differential diagnosis.\n\nConsidering the severity of the symptoms and the fact that the patient is pregnant, a urinary tract infection should be treated promptly to prevent potential complications such as pyelonephritis or sepsis. \n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Ampicillin - This is a broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic that can cover a range of bacteria, including E. coli. However, it may not be the most effective choice for treating UTIs in pregnant women due to concerns about resistance and potential side effects.\n\nB. Ceftriaxone - This is a third-generation cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity against many Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli. It is often used as a first-line treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in pregnant women.\n\nC.

However, the context provided points more towards a condition that would cause sudden increase in pulmonary vascular resistance.\n\n2. **Recent surgery for a fractured femur**: This is a critical clue. The patient underwent surgery 3 months prior to her death, which could have led to an inflammatory response or a complication related to the surgical procedure itself.\n\n3. **Acute hypoxic respiratory failure and cardiac arrest following discharge from rehab**: These symptoms suggest that the condition causing the sudden increase in pulmonary vascular resistance was severe enough to cause acute right ventricular failure, leading to cardiac arrest.\n\n4. **Histological examination of lung tissue showing fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery**: This finding is consistent with pulmonary hypertension (C), which can lead to fibrosis and thickening of the walls of small pulmonary arteries and arterioles, causing them to constrict and increase vascular resistance.\n\nGiven these points, the most likely pathogenesis for the present findings is **pulmonary hypertension**. Pulmonary hypertension would explain the sudden increase in pulmonary vascular resistance leading to acute right ventricular failure and cardiac arrest following surgery.\n\nThe other options can be ruled out as follows:\n- Thromboembolism (A) might cause sudden death but typically does not result in fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery.\n- Pulmonary ischemia (B) could also lead to acute right ventricular failure, but it would more likely present with signs of ischemia rather than fibrosis and increased vascular resistance.\n- Pulmonary passive congestion (D) is a condition that might cause sudden death due to cardiac arrest, but it typically does not result in the formation of fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery.", "pred_ans": "C"}

Such defects are often associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernias (CDH), which can occur in various forms, including bilateral CDH.\n\n2. **Bilateral CDH**: The fact that there was a defect in the pleuroperitoneal membrane at 20 weeks' gestation suggests that this patient may have had bilateral CDH. Bilateral CDH is more common than unilateral CDH and often presents with respiratory distress due to lung hypoplasia (underdevelopment) and mediastinal shift.\n\n3. **Respiratory distress**: The fact that the patient was delivered at 39 weeks' gestation but still experienced respiratory distress suggests that there may be some residual lung tissue or issues with lung development, which could be related to the pleuroperitoneal membrane defect.\n\n4. **Options analysis**:\n   - A. Gastric fundus in the thorax: This finding is more suggestive of a gastric duplication anomaly rather than a CDH.\n   - B. Pancreatic ring around the duodenum: This finding can be associated with pancreatic anomalies, but it's not directly related to CDH or pleuroperitoneal membrane defects.\n   - C. Hypertrophy of the gastric pylorus: This is more suggestive of pyloric stenosis rather than a CDH.\n   - D. Large bowel in the inguinal canal: While this could be seen in some cases of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, it's not as directly related to the pleuroperitoneal membrane defect and bilateral CDH.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely finding associated with this patient is a large bowel in the inguinal canal.

This implies we're dealing with specific types of glucose transporters (e.g., GLUT4 in skeletal muscle, GLUT3 in adipocytes) that have unique characteristics.\n\n2. **Role of Insulin**: Insulin is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells. However, its direct effect on increasing glucose uptake in specific cell types (like skeletal muscle and adipocytes) without affecting other cell types is limited.\n\n3. **Analyzing Options**:\n   - A. **Increased levels of circulating insulin**: Insulin's primary role is to increase blood glucose levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells, not specifically targeting skeletal muscle or adipocytes.\n   - B. **Increased plasma glucose concentration**: This option suggests a direct effect on glucose levels in the bloodstream, which aligns with how insulin works but doesn't directly address selective increase in specific cell types.\n   - C. **Decreased plasma glucose concentration**: This would actually decrease blood glucose levels, which is counterintuitive to the purpose of insulin and glucose transporters.\n   - D. **It is physiologically impossible to selectively increase glucose uptake in specific cells**: This option acknowledges that insulin's primary action is not specifically targeting skeletal muscle or adipocytes but suggests a theoretical impossibility based on current understanding.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the above analysis, the most logical answer is D.

The medication's mechanism of action suggests it is a beta-blocker.\n2. Beta-blockers are known to have a negative inotropic effect (decrease contractility) and chronotropic effect (slowing heart rate), which would exacerbate symptoms of CHF such as shortness of breath, lower leg edema, and fatigue.\n3.

Epinephrine - This is a catecholamine with both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic effects. It would increase heart rate and contractility, which would worsen CHF symptoms.\nB. Isoproterenol - This is also a beta-adrenergic agonist that primarily stimulates beta-2 receptors. Like epinephrine, it would increase heart rate and contractility, exacerbating CHF symptoms.\nC. Norepinephrine - This is another catecholamine with both alpha and beta adrenergic effects. It has a strong vasoconstrictive effect, which could worsen edema in the lower legs.\nD. Dobutamine - This medication is a beta-1 selective adrenergic agonist that also has some alpha-adrenergic activity. However, it has a unique property of having minimal effects on heart rate and contractility compared to other beta-blockers. It can be used as an inotrope (increases cardiac output) in the setting of acute decompensated CHF.\n\nGiven the patient's condition and the medication's mechanism of action, dobutamine is the most appropriate choice because it targets beta-1 adrenergic receptors preferentially over beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which aligns with the prescribed treatment.

Noncontrast CT of the head: This test would be useful for identifying any acute hemorrhages or other abnormalities within the brain, which could explain the recent onset of confusion and altered mental status. However, given the patient's history of hepatic encephalopathy and recent onset of symptoms, this might not be the most directly relevant diagnostic step.\n\nB. Therapeutic trial of lactulose: Lactulose is a medication commonly used to treat hepatic encephalopathy by reducing ammonia levels in the blood. Given that the patient has mild asterixis (indicative of hepatic encephalopathy) and recent onset of confusion, starting a therapeutic trial of lactulose would be a logical next step.\n\nC. Abdominal paracentesis: This test could be useful for diagnosing conditions such as ascites or hydrocephalus, which might explain the abdominal distension and mild asterixis. However, given the patient's presentation, it is less directly relevant to her current symptoms of confusion and altered mental status.\n\nD. Serum ammonia level: While measuring serum ammonia levels can provide valuable information about hepatic encephalopathy, this test would not be as immediately diagnostic for the acute presentation of confusion and altered mental status in this patient.\n\nConsidering these factors, starting a therapeutic trial of lactulose (B) is likely to have the most immediate impact on addressing the patient's symptoms and could potentially provide valuable information about her condition.

This suggests that the stain is targeting a specific component within these structures.\n\n2. **Considering the options**:\n   - A. Microtubule: Microtubules are components of the cytoskeleton, which provide structural support to the cell. They are involved in various cellular processes, including cell division and transport. However, they are not typically associated with staining patterns that specifically target soma and dendrites.\n   - B. Nucleus: The nucleus is a distinct organelle within the cell where DNA is stored. Given that only the soma (where the nucleus is located) is visualized after aniline stain, it suggests that the stain might be targeting components associated with the nucleus or its functions.\n   - C. Lysosome: Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles involved in cellular digestion and recycling of macromolecules. They do not typically interact with aniline stains used for staining neurons.\n   - D. Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER): The RER is a type of rough endoplasmic reticulum that is involved in protein synthesis, folding, and transport within the cell. It does not have a direct association with staining patterns targeting soma and dendrites.\n\n3. **Making an educated guess**: Given the information above, the most plausible explanation for the observed staining pattern is that the aniline stain is specifically targeting components associated with the nucleus or its functions.

Malassezia yeast is a common cause of skin infections in individuals with compromised immune systems or those who have recently shaved, as it thrives in oily environments. However, the fact that the lesions do not tan upon sun exposure makes this less likely, as Malassezia yeast typically produces pigment.\n\nNext, let's consider option B. Cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a type of skin cancer that can present with hypopigmented macules, but it often has a different clinical presentation and does not typically respond to sun exposure.\n\nOption C, TYR gene dysfunction in melanocytes, refers to the condition oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1), which is characterized by reduced melanin production. While this can lead to hypopigmentation, it would more likely present with lighter skin rather than dark-colored lesions on the chest and abdomen.\n\nOption D, Treponema pallidum infection, refers to syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection that can cause a wide range of symptoms, including skin rashes. However, the typical presentation of syphilitic rashes is more widespread and often accompanied by other systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, and lymphadenopathy.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A, Malassezia yeast, is the most likely cause of this patient's lesions. This is because Malassezia yeast is a common skin commensal that can thrive in oily environments, leading to conditions like pityriasis versicolor (a type of dermatitis characterized by hypopigmented macules).

The patient's statement about rarely leaving his house except for mandatory business does not align with the typical features of dependent personality disorder.\n\nC. **Histrionic Personality Disorder**: Characterized by excessive emotionality, attention-seeking behavior, and a need for approval from others. While individuals with histrionic personality disorder may exhibit some anxiety-related behaviors, they are not typically described as being uncomfortable in large crowds or on public transportation.\n\nD. **Schizotypal Personality Disorder**: This disorder is marked by eccentric behavior, social isolation, and an odd way of perceiving reality (e.g., seeing things that others do not). The patient's history of discomfort with crowded environments since childhood could be related to a schizotypal personality disorder, as individuals with this disorder may exhibit unusual perceptions or feelings of unease in novel situations.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the most likely genetic association for this patient's condition is Schizotypal Personality Disorder. This diagnosis aligns with his history of discomfort in large crowds and public transportation, which are characteristic symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder.", "pred_ans": "D"}

He has no pain and the left eye is asymptomatic. He was treated for fungal esophagitis 6 months ago with fluconazole. He was diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma 2 years ago. Current medications include efavirenz, tenofovir, emtricitabine, azithromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, multivitamins, and a nutritional supplement.

Examination shows cervical lymphadenopathy. There are multiple violaceous plaques seen over his trunk and extremities. Fundoscopic examination shows granular yellow-white opacities around the retinal vessels and multiple areas of dot-blot hemorrhages. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 36/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "answer": "Cytomegalovirus retinitis", "options": {"A": "Cytomegalovirus retinitis", "B": "Toxoplasma retinitis", "C": "HIV retinopathy", "D": "Varicella zoster retinitis"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's history of AIDS, Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), and current symptoms such as decreasing vision, seeing black spots in one eye, and dot-blot hemorrhages on fundoscopic examination, we can consider several potential diagnoses. However, the presence of multiple violaceous plaques over his trunk and extremities is particularly noteworthy.\n\nFirstly, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis: This condition is a common complication in immunocompromised patients, including those with AIDS. CMV retinitis typically presents with vitiligo-like lesions on the retina and can cause significant vision loss if left untreated. The presence of violaceous plaques could be indicative of CMV infection.\n\nB. Toxoplasma retinitis: This is another opportunistic infection that can affect individuals with AIDS, particularly those who are immunocompromised. However, it typically presents with more focal lesions on the retina and may not cause widespread vitiligo-like changes.\n\nC. HIV retinopathy: While HIV-related retinopathy can cause various changes in the retina, including microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates, it is less likely to present with violaceous plaques or dot-blot hemorrhages.\n\nD. Varicella zoster retinitis: This condition typically affects individuals who have had chickenpox (varicella) in the past, often as a result of reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. It can cause vitiligo-like lesions on the retina and may present with dot-blot hemorrhages, but it is less likely to be associated with violaceous plaques.\n\nConsidering these factors, the presence of multiple violaceous plaques over his trunk and extremities, combined with the patient's history of AIDS, Kaposi's sarcoma, and current symptoms, makes option A (Cytomegalovirus retinitis) the most likely diagnosis. This is because CMV retinitis can cause widespread vitiligo-like lesions on the retina, including violaceous plaques, which are consistent with the patient's presentation.", "pred_ans": "A"}

Decreased activity of this enzyme has been associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation, which could contribute to the development of cholangitis.\n\nC. **Decreased HMG-coenzyme A reductase activity**: This is the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. While alterations in cholesterol metabolism can have various effects on the body, decreased HMG-CoA reductase activity is not directly linked to the specific clinical presentation described.\n\nD. **Increased \u03b2-glucuronidase activity**: This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of bilirubin and other substances. Increased activity would likely lead to increased bilirubin levels, which contradicts the findings of jaundice.\n\nGiven the evidence of cholelithiasis, biliary dilation, and cholangitis, the most plausible underlying cause is related to an imbalance in oxidative stress and inflammation, which can be linked to decreased heme oxygenase activity. This enzyme plays a crucial role in protecting against oxidative damage by breaking down heme into less toxic compounds.", "pred_ans": "B"}

The physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds and mild expiratory wheezing over the lower right lung field.\n\nGiven these findings, it's likely that the foreign body has caused an obstruction in the airway, leading to increased resistance and decreased airflow through the affected part of the lung. This would result in a decrease in blood flow to that area due to the increased vascular resistance.\n\nThe chest X-ray confirms this suspicion, showing a round foreign body in the lower portion of the right inferior lobe.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA. Blood flow would be increased due to arterial vasodilation.\n- This is unlikely because the symptoms and physical examination findings suggest an obstruction rather than vasodilation.\n\nB. Blood flow would be unchanged due to autoregulation.\n- Autoregulation is a mechanism that maintains blood flow at a constant level despite changes in systemic or local metabolic rates. However, this doesn't apply directly to the situation described, where there's an apparent increase in vascular resistance due to obstruction.\n\nC.

This implies that we are looking at how blood vessels respond to a specific stimulus (acetylcholine) before and after a potential underlying condition.\n\n2. **The role of acetylcholine**: Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that can cause the smooth muscle surrounding blood vessels to relax, leading to an increase in vascular diameter. This effect is often used as a diagnostic tool for coronary artery disease because it can help identify whether or not there is significant vasodilation (widening) of the arteries.\n\n3. **The observed effect**: An increase of 7% in the vascular diameter after acetylcholine injection suggests that the response to acetylcholine was positive, indicating normal or near-normal vasodilation.\n\n4. **Considering the options**:\n   - A. Nitric oxide from endothelial cells: Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator produced by the endothelium (the inner lining of blood vessels). It plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular tone and function. An increase in nitric oxide production would likely lead to an increase in vascular diameter, consistent with the observed effect.\n   - B. Endothelin from the peripheral vasculature: Endothelin is a vasoconstrictor produced by the endothelium. It can cause blood vessels to constrict or narrow, which would decrease vascular diameter rather than increase it.\n   - C. Serotonin from neuroendocrine cells: Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that can also cause vasoconstriction in some cases. However, its effect on vascular diameter is generally more variable and less consistent compared to nitric oxide.\n   - D. Norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla: Norepinephrine is a catecholamine that can cause vasoconstriction. While it could potentially increase vascular diameter in some contexts, its effect would likely be more pronounced than an 7% increase.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the understanding of acetylcholine's role as a vasodilator and the expected response to normal or near-normal vasodilation, the most likely cause of the observed effect is nitric oxide from endothelial cells.", "pred_ans": "A"}

Emphysema: In emphysema, the alveoli are damaged and have a reduced surface area for gas exchange. This would lead to an increase in dead space ventilation, where air is not fully exchanged with blood, resulting in lower oxygen levels in the alveoli compared to the trachea.\n\nB. Pulmonary fibrosis: In pulmonary fibrosis, there is scarring of lung tissue, which can lead to a decrease in the surface area available for gas exchange. However, this does not necessarily mean that the oxygen content in the trachea would resemble the oxygen content in the affected alveoli.\n\nC. Pulmonary embolism: A pulmonary embolism blocks blood flow to one or more areas of the lung, which can lead to a decrease in oxygenation of the affected area. However, this does not necessarily mean that the oxygen content in the trachea would resemble the oxygen content in the affected alveoli.\n\nD.

His temperature is 39.7\u00b0C (103.5\u00b0F), blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and pulse is 115/min. On physical examination, the skin is flushed. Mucous membranes are dry, and pupils are dilated. There is pronounced clonus in the extremities bilaterally. Babinski sign is present bilaterally. All the patient\u2019s medications are discontinued, and intravenous fluids are started. Which of the following drugs most likely interacted with phenelzine to cause this patient\u2019s condition?", "answer": "Sertraline", "options": {"A": "Mirtazapine", "B": "Bupropion", "C": "Sertraline", "D": "Lithium"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation of restlessness, disorientation, sweating, tremors, mumbling to himself, and pronounced clonus in the extremities bilaterally, along with a history of major depressive disorder and recent initiation of phenelzine (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor or MAOI), we can deduce that this patient is experiencing a hypertensive crisis due to the interaction between phenelzine and another medication.\n\nPhenelzine is an MAOI, which means it inhibits the enzyme monoamine oxidase. This inhibition leads to an accumulation of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain, causing increased levels of these neurotransmitters. However, when combined with other medications that also increase serotonin or norepinephrine levels (such as certain antidepressants), this can lead to a hypertensive crisis.\n\nThe key here is to identify which medication among the options could potentially interact with phenelzine and cause this patient's condition.\n\nA. Mirtazapine - This is an antidepressant that also increases serotonin levels, making it a potential interaction partner for phenelzine.\nB. Bupropion - While bupropion can increase norepinephrine levels, its primary mechanism of action is as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), not an MAOI. Therefore, it's less likely to cause the hypertensive crisis described.\nC. Sertraline - This is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and does not have significant interactions with phenelzine that would lead to a hypertensive crisis.\nD. Lithium - While lithium can increase serum levels of other medications, including MAOIs like phenelzine, its primary mechanism of action is as a mood stabilizer and anticonvulsant. It's less likely to cause the specific symptoms described.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most likely interaction that led to this patient's condition is with mirtazapine (A), which increases serotonin levels in addition to phenelzine's MAOI activity.", "pred_ans": "A"}

Adrenocortical carcinoma** and **D. Granulosa cell tumour** are less likely due to their different symptom profiles (e.g., adrenal gland tumors typically present with hypertension, weight loss, or a distinctive \"moon\" sign on imaging).\n- **B. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour** is also unlikely as it would more commonly present with virilization of male external genitalia rather than the female symptoms described.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nA. **Thecoma**: Thecomas are a type of sex cord-stromal tumor that can produce estrogen and androgen.

{"idx": 702, "question": "A 58-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of difficulty walking, clumsiness of her arms and legs, and slurred speech. Physical examination shows masked facies and a slow, shuffling gait. When her ankles are passively flexed, there is involuntary, jerky resistance. Treatment is initiated with a combination of levodopa and carbidopa. The addition of carbidopa is most likely to decrease the risk of which of the following potential adverse drug effects?", "answer": "Orthostatic hypotension", "options": {"A": "Resting tremor", "B": "Orthostatic hypotension", "C": "Visual hallucinations", "D": "Dyskinesia"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo approach this question, let's first understand the context and the treatment initiated by the physician.\n\n1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 58-year-old woman with symptoms of difficulty walking, clumsiness, slurred speech, masked facies, and a slow, shuffling gait. These symptoms are suggestive of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is characterized by motor symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and postural instability.\n\n2. **Treatment Initiated**: The physician starts the patient on a combination of levodopa and carbidopa. Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine, which is the neurotransmitter that is deficient in PD due to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Carbidopa is a decarboxylase inhibitor that prevents levodopa from being converted into dopamine outside the brain.\n\n3. **Potential Adverse Drug Effects (ADEs)**: The question asks about the potential ADEs associated with carbidopa, which are:\n   - Resting tremor\n   - Orthostatic hypotension\n   - Visual hallucinations\n   - Dyskinesia\n\n4. **Carbidopa's Mechanism of Action**: Carbidopa works by inhibiting the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, thereby increasing the amount of levodopa that reaches the brain where it is needed. This increase in levodopa levels can help alleviate symptoms of PD.\n\n5. **Decreasing Dyskinesia Risk**: The key point here is understanding how carbidopa affects the risk of dyskinesia (a type of involuntary movement disorder) in patients with Parkinson's disease. Carbidopa does not directly affect dopamine receptors or the dopaminergic system, which are the primary targets for levodopa in treating PD.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that carbidopa increases the amount of levodopa available to cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the brain where it is needed, it decreases the risk of dyskinesia by ensuring a more effective treatment of Parkinson's disease symptoms.", "pred_ans": "D"}

He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, and was recently diagnosed with parathyroid disease. He drinks 1\u20132 ounces of whiskey daily and occasionally more on weekends. His brother has ankylosing spondylitis. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right leg shows an abrasion below the patella. There is swelling and tenderness of the right knee; range of motion is limited by pain. Arthrocentesis of the right knee joint yields 15 mL of cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 26,300/mm3 (91% segmented neutrophils).

The key to solving this question lies in understanding the relationship between the patient's symptoms and potential predisposing factors.\n\nFirstly, let's consider the patient's history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. While these conditions are important for overall cardiovascular health, they are not directly related to the development of CPPD or pseudogout.\n\nNext, we examine the patient's recent medical history. The episode of diarrhea 3 weeks ago is notable because it resolved without treatment, which might initially suggest a gastrointestinal infection as a predisposing factor. However, this does not directly relate to the current knee symptoms.\n\nThe patient's brother has ankylosing spondylitis, a form of arthritis that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints. While there is a familial component to some forms of arthritis, it is not directly relevant to the patient's current condition.\n\nRegarding the patient's history of recent alcohol consumption (1-2 ounces daily), moderate drinking can increase the risk of developing CPPD or pseudogout due to its effect on calcium metabolism and kidney function. However, this factor alone does not explain the patient's symptoms.\n\nThe examination findings are crucial here. The presence of a local skin abrasion below the patella is a key finding that points towards a specific diagnosis: pseudogout. Pseudogout is characterized by the sudden onset of joint pain and swelling due to the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals within the joint space.\n\nThe microscopic examination of the synovial fluid under polarized light shows rhomboid-shaped, weakly positively birefringent crystals. This finding is diagnostic for CPPD or pseudogout, as these crystals are characteristic of this condition.\n\nConsidering all the above points, the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition appears to be his recent alcohol consumption, particularly moderate drinking.

The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding.\n2. Pelvic examination reveals blood and clots in the posterior fornix, which suggests that there may be an endometrial hyperplasia or atrophy.\n3. An endometrial biopsy specimen shows straight uniform tubular glands lined with tall pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells with high mitotic activity embedded in an edematous stroma.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the patient likely has endometrial hyperplasia due to hormonal imbalance.\n\nThe histologic appearance of the biopsy specimen is characterized by:\n\n* Straight uniform tubular glands lined with tall pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells\n* High mitotic activity embedded in an edematous stroma\n\nThese features are typical of endometrial hyperplasia, which is often caused by estrogen excess.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA. Luteinizing hormone (LH) - LH stimulates the growth of the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. While LH can stimulate the growth of endometrial glands, it is not directly responsible for the histologic appearance described in this case.\n\nB. Corpus luteum - As mentioned earlier, the corpus luteum is stimulated by LH to produce progesterone, but it does not cause the histologic appearance described in this case.\n\nC. 5-alpha-reductase - This enzyme is involved in the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which plays a role in the development of prostate tissue. It is not directly related to endometrial hyperplasia.\n\nD. Aromatase - This enzyme is responsible for converting androgens into estrogens, which are then converted into estriol by the placenta during pregnancy. In non-pregnant women, aromatase activity is low, but in pregnant women, it increases significantly to support fetal development. The increased estrogen production leads to an increase in endometrial thickness and proliferation, resulting in endometrial hyperplasia.", "pred_ans": "D"}

The key findings are:\n\n- Mild proteinuria: This suggests that the kidneys are not completely failing, but rather have some degree of damage or dysfunction.\n- Elevated serum creatinine concentration: Creatinine is a waste product produced by the normal functioning of muscles. When the kidneys are not working properly, they cannot remove this waste product effectively, leading to elevated levels in the blood.\n\nGiven these findings, we can consider the potential causes:\n\nA. Cobblestone kidney - This is a benign condition characterized by small, rounded nodules on the renal cortex. It is often associated with chronic pyelonephritis or other conditions that cause scarring and fibrosis of the kidneys. While it could potentially lead to some degree of proteinuria, it is less likely given the patient's presentation.\n\nB.

They involve nodular glomerulosclerosis and are associated with significant proteinuria and renal failure. However, in this case, we do not see any evidence of diabetes or other conditions that would suggest diabetic nephropathy.\n\nC. Renal cortex necrosis - This is a severe condition characterized by the death of kidney tissue in the cortical region. It can be caused by various factors, including ischemia (lack of blood flow), toxins, and certain medications. While it could potentially lead to some degree of proteinuria, it is less likely given the patient's presentation.\n\nD.

Current medications are metformin, aspirin, rosuvastatin, captopril, and furosemide. His vital signs are an irregular pulse of 74/min, a respiratory rate of 14/min, a blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg, and a temperature of 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F). His BMI is 32 kg/m2.

The presence of visible jugular pulsations suggests dehydration, which is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. Dehydration can lead to hypovolemia, decreased renal perfusion, and potentially acute kidney injury.\n\nThe patient's laboratory findings indicate that he has mild hyperglycemia (Hb A1c 7.5%) and elevated fasting blood glucose levels (120 mg/dL). These values are consistent with diabetes mellitus type 2, which is a common cause of polyuria (frequent urination) due to the body's inability to regulate blood sugar effectively.\n\nThe management of hyperglycemia in diabetic patients requires careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks of different treatment options. However, given the patient's current presentation, stopping metformin may not be the best initial step as it is a first-line medication for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, replacing captopril with valsartan or starting rosiglitazone would not address the underlying issue of hyperglycemia.\n\nExenatide is an insulin secretagogue that stimulates the release of insulin from the pancreas. While it may be beneficial in some patients with type 2 diabetes, it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for managing hyperglycemia due to its potential side effects and the availability of more effective treatments like metformin.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step would be to start metformin, which has been shown to improve glycemic control in diabetic patients. This medication can help reduce blood glucose levels and alleviate symptoms such as polyuria.

{"idx": 893, "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician's office by his parents for a scheduled visit. His father tells the physician that he has observed, on several occasions, that his son has difficulty breathing. This is more prominent when he is outside playing with his friends. These symptoms are increased during the spring and winter seasons, and, of late, the boy has one such episode almost every week. During these episodes, he usually wheezes, coughs, and seems to be winded as if something was restricting his ability to breathe. These symptoms have not affected his sleep at night. This breathlessness does not limit his daily activities, and whenever he does have an episode it subsides after he gets some rest. He does not have any other pertinent medical history and is not on any medication. His physical examination does not reveal any significant findings. The pediatrician checks his expiratory flow rate in the office and estimates it to be around 85% after conducting it three times. Which of the following drugs is the pediatrician most likely to start this patient on?", "answer": "Inhaled albuterol", "options": {"A": "Inhaled salmeterol", "B": "Inhaled albuterol", "C": "High-dose budesonide", "D": "Oral prednisone"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nThe pediatrician's primary concern is the 5-year-old boy's difficulty breathing, which is exacerbated by outdoor activities during certain seasons and worsens in the spring and winter months. This pattern suggests an allergic component to his symptoms.\n\nGiven that the boy does not have a history of allergies or asthma, the most likely diagnosis is exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB), also known as asthma-like symptoms due to physical exertion. The fact that these episodes are triggered by outdoor activities during specific seasons further supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe pediatrician's goal is to alleviate the boy's symptoms and prevent future episodes. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are generally considered the first-line treatment for EIB, as they reduce inflammation in the airways without causing bronchodilation, which can worsen asthma-like symptoms.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **Inhaled salmeterol** is a long-acting beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) that would be more suitable for controlling symptoms of asthma rather than EIB. While it could help with bronchospasm, it might not address the underlying inflammation.\n\nB. **Inhaled albuterol** is also a LABA and can provide quick relief from acute bronchospasm but may not be sufficient to control symptoms over time due to its short duration of action.\n\nC. **High-dose budesonide** is an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) that would be more suitable for long-term management of EIB, as it reduces inflammation and prevents exacerbations. However, starting with a high dose might not be necessary initially, especially since the boy's symptoms are mild.\n\nD. **Oral prednisone** is a systemic corticosteroid that can provide rapid relief from acute bronchospasm but has significant side effects, including growth suppression in children and potential long-term consequences such as osteoporosis and Cushing's syndrome. It would not be the first-line treatment for EIB.\n\nGiven these considerations, the pediatrician should start with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) to reduce inflammation and prevent exacerbations of EIB. Among the options provided, **A. Inhaled salmeterol** is the most suitable choice as a starting point, although it might not be sufficient on its own for long-term management.", "pred_ans": "A"}

Samples obtained from the boy\u2019s red blood cells show a malformed protein with a length of 160 amino acids (in normal, healthy red blood cells, the functional protein has a length of 146 amino acids). Which of the following best accounts for these findings?", "answer": "Splice site mutation", "options": {"A": "Frameshift mutation", "B": "Missense mutation", "C": "Nonsense mutation", "D": "Splice site mutation"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo approach this question, let's consider what we know about beta thalassemia and the types of mutations that can affect protein function.\n\nBeta thalassemia is a genetic disorder characterized by reduced or absent production of the beta-globin chains of hemoglobin. This results in anemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis (red blood cell production). The malformed protein found in the boy's red blood cells suggests that there has been a mutation affecting the structure or function of the beta-globin chain.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Frameshift mutation: A frameshift mutation occurs when an insertion or deletion of nucleotides changes the reading frame of the genetic code, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence. This type of mutation is unlikely to result in a protein with 160 amino acids, as it would likely introduce stop codons or premature termination signals.\n\nB. Missense mutation: A missense mutation involves a change in one amino acid residue in a protein due to a point mutation in the DNA sequence. While this can lead to changes in protein function, it typically results in a single amino acid substitution rather than a significant increase in size (160 amino acids).\n\nC. Nonsense mutation: A nonsense mutation is a type of point mutation that introduces a premature stop codon into the genetic code, leading to a truncated and often non-functional protein. This would result in a shorter protein with fewer amino acids.\n\nD. Splice site mutation: A splice site mutation involves a change at one of the introns (non-coding regions) or exons (coding regions) that affects the splicing process, leading to aberrant mRNA processing and potentially resulting in an abnormal protein. This type of mutation can lead to significant changes in protein size.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most likely explanation for the malformed protein with a length of 160 amino acids is a splice site mutation. This would disrupt normal mRNA splicing, leading to aberrant protein production that results in the observed 160-amino acid protein.", "pred_ans": "D"}

Smooth muscle tumor arising from the myometrium: A smooth muscle tumor in the uterus could potentially cause obstructive symptoms like painful diarrhea by compressing or blocking the fallopian tubes. This option seems plausible given the patient's symptoms of pelvic pain and painful diarrhea.\n\nC. Primary failure of the ovaries: While ovarian failure can lead to infertility, it would not directly explain the patient's symptoms of pelvic pain and painful diarrhea.\n\nD. Scarring of the fallopian tubes: Scarring from a previous ectopic pregnancy or other tubal damage could cause infertility but is less likely to be the primary cause of this patient's symptoms.\n\nConsidering these options, the most plausible explanation for the patient's symptoms (pelvic pain and painful diarrhea) would be related to a condition that affects the uterus and fallopian tubes.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - While COPD is a common cause of chronic shortness of breath and cough, it typically presents with more pronounced airflow limitation on lung function tests, such as a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) that is less than 70% of the predicted value. In this case, the flow-volume loop obtained via pulmonary function testing is not explicitly described, but we can infer that COPD would likely show some degree of airflow limitation.\n\nB. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) - IPF is a chronic and progressive disease characterized by interstitial lung fibrosis, which leads to restrictive lung disease. It often presents with worsening shortness of breath, cough, and weight loss over years, as seen in this patient. The flow-volume loop would likely show decreased lung volumes due to fibrosis.\n\nC. Endotracheal neoplasm - An endotracheal neoplasm is a rare condition where a tumor grows within the trachea or bronchi. While it can cause respiratory symptoms, it is less common and typically presents with more acute symptoms such as sudden onset of shortness of breath, cough, and hemoptysis.\n\nD. Unilateral mainstem obstruction - A unilateral mainstem obstruction would likely present with more severe symptoms such as significant unilateral cough, hemoptysis, and possibly a decrease in oxygen saturation due to decreased ventilation of the affected side.

This indicates that there is a possible genetic link to eye problems in this family.\n\n3. **Considering inheritance modes**:\n   - **Mitochondrial inheritance (A)**: Mitochondria are the energy-producing structures within cells. While mitochondrial diseases can be inherited, they typically affect only females and are not directly linked to eye conditions.\n   - **Autosomal recessive (B)**: This mode of inheritance means that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. However, this does not explain why the child's vision problems are specific to one activity.\n   - **Y-linked dominant (C)**: Y-linked traits are passed down through the Y chromosome. While some X-linked conditions can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, a Y-linked dominant trait would not typically affect eye color or vision directly.\n   - **X-linked recessive (D)**: This mode of inheritance involves genes on the X chromosome. The most common X-linked recessive condition is Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which affects boys more frequently than girls due to its X-linked nature.\n\n4. **Connecting the dots**: Given that the child's vision problems are specific to one activity and considering the options provided, the most likely cause of these changes in the patient's vision involves an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance.

The antibiotic blocks protein synthesis by first entering the cell and then binding to active ribosomes.\n2. The antibiotic mimics the structure of aminoacyl-tRNA.\n\nGiven these details, we can infer that the process involves the interaction with ribosomal subunits. Let's analyze each option in relation to this information:\n\nA. 40S small subunit - This is a part of the ribosome where protein synthesis occurs, but it's not directly involved in binding to aminoacyl-tRNA or peptidyl transferase.\n\nB.

E site - The E site is where aminoacyl-tRNA binds during protein synthesis, and peptidyl transferase occurs after this step. However, the question states that the antibiotic \"mimics the structure of aminoacyl-tRNA,\" which suggests a more direct interaction with the ribosome rather than just binding to an existing tRNA.\n\nD. P site - The P site is where the growing peptide chain is attached by peptidyl transferase during protein synthesis. This process involves aminoacyl-tRNA, and the antibiotic's mechanism of action (binding to aminoacyl-tRNA and mimicking its structure) aligns with this step.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely site for the antibiotic's mechanism of action is the P site, where it binds to the growing peptide chain via peptidyl transferase, thereby impairing protein synthesis.\n\n## Answer Explanation:\nThe question describes an antibiotic that modifies protein synthesis by binding to aminoacyl-tRNA and mimicking its structure.

It requires a 5'-phosphate group from one DNA strand and a 3'-hydroxyl group from another, which are not present on intact thymine nucleotides. Therefore, DNA ligase would be inactive on demethylated thymine nucleotides.\n  \n- **Telomerase**: This enzyme is involved in the maintenance of telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. It adds TTAGGG sequences to the ends of telomeres by extending the 3'-hydroxyl group from its catalytic site.

The fact that it is loudest at the apex and during end-expiration also supports this diagnosis.\n\nD. Right bundle branch block: This condition typically presents with a systolic ejection murmur due to the delayed activation of the right ventricle. It may also cause a diastolic rumble, but it is less likely to cause a dull, low-pitched sound during late diastole.\n\nConsidering these options, the most likely cause of the finding described in the question is fusion of mitral valve leaflets, which can lead to a mid-diastolic murmur that matches the description provided.", "pred_ans": "C"}

It also carries taste from the posterior one-third of the tongue.\n\n3. **Analyze the options**:\n   - A. Uvula movement: The uvula is a soft, movable piece of tissue at the back of the throat. While it's part of the pharynx, its movement isn't directly related to cranial nerve VII or IX.\n   - B. Facial sensation: As mentioned earlier, facial sensation is primarily associated with cranial nerve VII (facial nerve).\n   - C. Eyelid closure: The muscles controlling eyelid closure are not directly related to the functions of cranial nerves VII and IX.\n   - D. Tongue protrusion: This action involves the muscles of the tongue, which can be controlled by both cranial nerves VII and IX.\n\n4. **Make a conclusion**: Given that decreased taste on the right anterior tongue is associated with cranial nerve VII (facial nerve), it's logical to conclude that this patient's condition is most likely caused by damage to the facial nerve.", "pred_ans": "B"}

This suggests that these cells can be visualized using fluorescence microscopy, allowing researchers to track their movement and behavior in vitro.\n\nNext, we're told that after 2 weeks, all samples show in vitro hematogenous invasion and migration away from the original site of insertion. Hematogenous invasion refers to the process by which cancer cells enter the bloodstream and travel to distant sites in the body. Migration away from the original site is a key step in metastasis.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Loss of cellular polarity - While loss of cellular polarity can affect cell behavior, it is not directly related to hematogenous invasion or migration. In fact, many cancer cells exhibit increased motility and invasiveness despite having normal polarity.\n\nB. Overexpression of HER2/neu - HER2/neu is a protein that promotes the growth and spread of certain types of breast cancer. However, its overexpression is not directly linked to hematogenous invasion or migration in vitro.\n\nC. Presence of fibrous tissue capsule - A fibrous tissue capsule can provide structural support and protection for tumor cells, but it does not typically facilitate their movement through the bloodstream.\n\nD. Release of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - MMPs are a family of enzymes that break down the extracellular matrix, allowing cancer cells to invade surrounding tissues and migrate to distant sites. The release of MMPs is a key step in the metastatic process.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely property responsible for the ability of these neoplastic cells to metastasize is the release of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP).

{"idx": 1142, "question": "A newlywed couple comes to your office for genetic counseling. Both potential parents are known to be carriers of the same Cystic Fibrosis (CF) mutation.

It is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disease. Carriers, who are heterozygous for the mutation (have one normal and one mutated allele), typically do not show symptoms but can pass the mutated allele to their offspring.\n\nGiven that both parents are carriers of the same CF mutation, we need to calculate the probability of at least one child having CF in three generations. To simplify this, let's first consider the probability of a single child having CF and then multiply it by the number of children (3).\n\n1. The probability of a parent being a carrier is 50% or 0.5 (since they are heterozygous for the mutation).\n2. The probability of a child inheriting two normal alleles (not carrying the mutated gene) from each parent is 25% or 0.25 (50% chance of not being a carrier x 50% chance of not being affected by CF).\n3. Therefore, the probability of a single child having no CF and being a carrier is 0.25.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for three generations:\n\n- **Generation 1:** Both parents are carriers (0.5 each). The probability that their single child has no CF and is not a carrier is 0.25.\n- **Generation 2:** Their children inherit the 0.25 probability of having no CF from their parent, so all three children have no CF and are not carriers. This means there's only one child who doesn't carry the mutated gene (the other two being carriers).\n- **Generation 3:** The single child from Generation 1 is a carrier (0.5). Their child inherits this carrier status from them, making it certain that their child will be a carrier and not have CF.\n\nGiven these probabilities, we can see that in three generations, the probability of at least one child having CF is actually 100% because all children will inherit the mutated gene from one parent who is a carrier. This means there's no chance of none or only one child having CF.", "pred_ans": "A"}

The presence of limited range of motion in the right hip joint, pain on movement, and tenderness in the groin area are all consistent with a femoral neck fracture.\n\nThe fact that the patient is scheduled for surgery suggests that she may have a high risk of osteoporosis or other bone-related conditions that could increase her susceptibility to fractures. Considering these factors, we can evaluate the answer choices:\n\nA. Reduced osteoblastic activity - Osteoblasts are responsible for bone formation. A reduced activity would lead to decreased bone density and an increased risk of fractures.\n\nB. Monoclonal antibody production - While certain monoclonal antibodies may be associated with bone diseases (e.g., parathyroid hormone-related protein), there is no direct link between monoclonal antibody production and hip fracture in this context.\n\nC. Impaired bone mineralization - This choice refers to a decrease in the process of bone formation, which would lead to decreased bone density and an increased risk of fractures.\n\nD. Defective osteoclast function - Osteoclasts are responsible for bone resorption. A defective function would lead to excessive bone resorption, potentially leading to osteoporosis or other bone-related conditions that could increase the risk of fractures.\n\nGiven these considerations, impaired bone mineralization (C) is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's fracture. This is because a decrease in bone formation activity would lead to decreased bone density and an increased risk of fractures, particularly in individuals with a history of falls or other traumatic events that may have contributed to her current condition.", "pred_ans": "C"}

These findings are highly suggestive of an underlying condition that affects multiple organ systems.\n\nFirstly, the presence of jaundice, erythema of the palms, and gynecomastia is indicative of a condition that leads to an imbalance in sex hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone. This can be seen in conditions like primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), where there is destruction of the bile ducts within the liver, leading to an increase in estrogen levels.\n\nThe patient's history of sexual activity with multiple partners increases the risk for sexually transmitted infections, but given his current symptoms, it is less likely that this is the cause. The absence of personal or family history of serious illness also makes chronic viral hepatitis (A) and congestive hepatopathy (B) less likely, as these conditions often have a more significant impact on liver function and may be associated with other systemic symptoms.\n\nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (D) is a condition characterized by inflammation of the liver with fat accumulation in liver cells. While it can lead to cirrhosis and hepatomegaly, it typically does not present with gynecomastia or an imbalance in sex hormones.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is primary biliary cirrhosis (C).

It presents with fever, headache, and anemia, but it does not typically cause a rash or lymphadenopathy.\n\nB. Chagas disease - This is a tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by triatomine bugs (kissing bugs). While it can affect the hematological system, it typically presents with more systemic symptoms such as fatigue, muscle pain, and gastrointestinal disturbances, rather than the specific combination of symptoms seen in this patient.\n\nC. Dengue fever - This is a mosquito-borne viral disease that causes severe flu-like symptoms, including high fever, headache, myalgias, and rash. However, it does not typically cause lymphadenopathy or anemia as described in this patient.\n\nD. Malaria - This is another mosquito-borne disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, which can affect the hematological system. It presents with fever, chills, flu-like symptoms, and anemia, but it does not typically cause a rash or lymphadenopathy.\n\nBased on the analysis of the patient's symptoms and travel history, the most likely diagnosis is tick-borne rickettsial infection, which is consistent with Dengue fever.", "pred_ans": "C"}

Ranitidine use: While ranitidine is an antihistamine used for its anti-ulcer properties and can be associated with neonatal hypoglycemia, there isn't a direct contraindication to breastfeeding based on ranitidine use alone.\n\nB. Hepatitis B infection: Hepatitis B is a significant concern because it can be transmitted from mother to child during birth if the mother has an active infection. However, hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all newborns, and the risk of transmission through breastfeeding is considered low if the mother is on effective antiviral therapy.\n\nC. Seropositive for cytomegalovirus (CMV): CMV is a viral infection that can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or childbirth. However, CMV infection in newborns is usually asymptomatic and does not significantly impact breastfeeding outcomes.\n\nD. Cannabis use: Cannabis use by the mother could potentially affect milk production or quality, but there isn't a well-established contraindication for breastfeeding based on cannabis use alone.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most significant concern that directly affects breastfeeding in this scenario would be hepatitis B infection (B), as it can pose a risk to the newborn's health if transmitted through breast milk.

This could be indicative of several arthropods, but given the context, it's likely related to an insect bite.\n\nThe fact that the child was bitten by a bug 2 hours prior and developed symptoms shortly after suggests that the arthropod responsible for the bite may have been transmitted through contact with contaminated soil or other environmental factors. The presence of erythema on the hand could be indicative of a specific type of venom, which is often associated with certain insect bites.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\n- A. Brown recluse: This spider's venom can cause necrotic lesions and systemic symptoms like abdominal pain, but it typically doesn't present with erythematous skin lesions.\n- B.

The anteromedial aspect of the thigh and lower leg is innervated by the femoral nerve. Therefore, damage to the femoral nerve could explain the sensory deficits.\n\nThe decreased patellar reflex on the left suggests involvement of the S1 nerve root, which is responsible for the motor control of the quadriceps muscles (responsible for knee extension) and also has a role in the patellar reflex. However, this symptom alone does not necessarily point to an S1 radiculopathy.\n\nThe decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch on the anteromedial thigh and medial lower leg suggests involvement of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN), which is responsible for these sensations. The LFCN is a branch of the femoral nerve, so damage to it could explain this symptom.\n\nThe decreased strength on hip flexion and knee extension also points towards an issue with the S1 radiculopathy or possibly the S2 radiculopathy, as both of these nerves are involved in the innervation of these muscles. However, given the specific pattern of weakness (3/5 on hip flexion and 2/5 on knee extension), it is more likely that we are dealing with an issue affecting the LFCN.\n\nConsidering all the symptoms together, the most likely underlying cause is a S1 radiculopathy, specifically involving the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.

Facial nerve damage (B) could also be considered but would not fully explain all his symptoms.\n\nDrug use (A) is less likely given the chronic nature of his symptoms and the fact that he has a history of myocardial infarction, which might suggest more acute rather than chronic drug-induced side effects.\n\nSyphilis (D) can cause a wide range of systemic symptoms, including skin rashes, but it would not typically present with such specific cranial nerve palsies or visual disturbances as described in this case.\n\nConsidering the patient's history of Lyme disease and the combination of his symptoms, the most likely associated condition is facial nerve damage. This could be due to a Pancoast tumor, which is a type of lung cancer that can spread to the nerves controlling eye movement and other cranial nerves, leading to the observed symptoms.", "pred_ans": "B"}

In this context, blinded interviewers will be assessing both cases and controls to determine their exposure to fiberglass. However, if the blinded interviewers have preconceived notions about which group is more likely to have been exposed (cases > controls), it could lead them to ask more questions about the exposures of the cases than the controls or vice versa, potentially introducing bias into the data.\n\nThis type of observer bias can be particularly problematic in case-control studies where the outcome of interest (mesothelioma) is often related to exposure. The blinded nature of the interviewers might inadvertently influence their assessment of exposure levels between groups, which could skew the results and lead to incorrect conclusions about the association between fiberglass exposure and mesothelioma risk.\n\nWhile interviewer bias (A), recall bias (B), and lead-time bias (D) are all potential sources of bias in research studies, they do not directly relate to the design of a case-control study as described.

Again, without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is the correct answer.\n\nC. **Trinucleotide repeat**: This type of mutation involves the expansion of trinucleotide repeats (e.g., CAG or GAA) within genes. Trinucleotide repeat disorders are a common cause of genetic diseases in various populations, including African Americans. Conditions like Fragile X syndrome and Huntington's disease can be inherited through these mechanisms.\n\nD. **Nonsense mutation**: This is a type of point mutation that results in a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. While nonsense mutations can cause various conditions, they are less commonly associated with trinucleotide repeat disorders or African American patients.\n\nGiven the patient's age, ethnicity, and family history, as well as her symptoms and treatment, **C.

This suggests an underlying immunodeficiency.\n2. **Family History**: The family history of sarcoidosis in the mother, diabetes in the father, and early childhood death in the maternal uncle points towards a genetic or familial component to the patient's condition.\n3. **Physical Examination Findings**: Scant lymphoid tissue on examination is noted, which can be indicative of an immunodeficiency affecting B-cell development or function.\n\nGiven these points, we need to consider what defects in proteins active during different stages of B-cell development could lead to such a clinical presentation and family history.\n\n- **Pro-B-cell stage (A)**: This stage is involved in the early stages of B-cell development. Defects here would more likely result in problems with antibody production rather than the specific immunodeficiency pattern seen in this case.\n  \n- **Pre-B-cell stage (B)**: These cells are precursors to mature B-cells and are also involved in the early stages of B-cell development. A defect here could lead to issues with antibody production, but it's less likely given the clinical context.\n\n- **Immature B-cell (C)**: Immature B-cells are still undergoing development and maturation processes. Defects in this stage could result in problems with both antibody production and the ability to mount an effective immune response, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and family history.\n\n- **Mature B-cell (D)**: Mature B-cells are fully developed and functional, producing antibodies. A defect here would more likely lead to issues with antibody production rather than the specific immunodeficiency pattern seen in this case.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely defect is one affecting immature B-cells, as it could explain both the clinical presentation of dyspnea and fever due to impaired antibody production and the family history of a genetic or familial component to the patient's condition.

Tuberculosis (TB) - While TB can cause chronic cough and sputum production, it typically presents with more systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and night sweats, which are not mentioned in this case.\n\nB. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency - This is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs, liver, and pancreas. It can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but it typically presents at an older age than 51 years.\n\nC. Bronchiectasis - This condition involves permanent enlargement of parts of the airways, which can lead to recurrent infections and sputum production. However, bronchiectasis is more commonly associated with a history of chronic cough and sputum production that has not responded to treatment, as well as findings on imaging such as dilated bronchi and bronchial wall thickening.\n\nD. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - This condition is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible and is typically associated with a history of smoking or exposure to noxious particles. The patient's non-smoker status, along with the presence of exacerbations similar to her previous presentations, makes COPD less likely.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely diagnosis in this case is bronchiectasis, as it aligns with the patient's long-standing cough and recurrent bouts of bronchitis, which have not responded to treatment.

CGG - This is the most common cause of Fragile X syndrome, which typically presents with intellectual disability, behavioral and learning challenges, and physical characteristics such as long face, protruding tongue, and large ears. While it could potentially lead to some of these symptoms, it's not the most likely given the specific combination of findings.\n\nB.

Fibrates are known to cause skin reactions such as pruritus and erythema (redness), but significant skin flushing is not a commonly reported side effect.

The patient is 32 years old and has not seen a doctor in 10 years, which raises concerns about his overall health and potential underlying conditions that may have been missed or misdiagnosed over time.\n\nThe physical examination finding of an early diastolic decrescendo blowing murmur radiating along the left sternal border is highly suggestive of aortic regurgitation (AR). This type of murmur is characterized by a continuous, low-pitched sound that decreases in intensity with respiration and increases with exercise. The fact that it radiates along the left sternal border also points towards aortic regurgitation.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible causes of AR:\n\nA. Syphilis: While syphilis can cause various cardiovascular abnormalities, including aortic regurgitation, it is not the most common cause in this age group.\n\nB. Connective tissue disease: Connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus can cause aortic regurgitation, but they are less likely to be associated with this specific physical examination finding.\n\nC. Myxomatous degeneration: This condition is more commonly associated with mitral valve prolapse rather than aortic regurgitation.\n\nD. Congenital bicuspid aortic valve: This is the most common cause of aortic regurgitation in adults, particularly those who have not undergone surgical correction for their congenital heart defect. The patient's age and lack of previous medical history make this option highly plausible.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely cause of his condition is congenital bicuspid aortic valve (D).

This is because SJS is characterized by specific changes in the skin, such as the presence of necrotic keratinocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils, which can be visualized through histopathological examination.\n\nThe other options are not as directly relevant to diagnosing SJS:\n\n- Gram stain and culture of a skin sample (A) would be more appropriate for diagnosing bacterial infections.\n- Direct immunofluorescence analysis of perilesional skin biopsy (C) is typically used to diagnose conditions such as dermatomyositis or lupus erythematosus, not SJS.\n- Flow cytometry (D) may be useful in diagnosing certain hematological disorders but is not the most appropriate test for this patient's condition.", "pred_ans": "B"}
{"idx": 1839, "question": "A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a 4-month history of reddening of the nose and cheeks. She has no itching or pain. She first noticed the redness while on a recent holiday in Spain, where she stayed at the beach and did daily wine tastings. She has tried several brands of sunscreen, stopped going outside in the middle of the day, and has not drunk alcohol since her trip, but the facial redness persists. She has no history of serious illness. Her younger sister has acne vulgaris, and her mother has systemic lupus erythematosus. The patient reports that she has had a lot of stress lately due to relationship problems with her husband. She does not smoke. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows erythema of the nose, chin, and medial cheeks with scant papules and telangiectasias. There are no comedones or blisters. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. In addition to behavioral modifications, which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment?", "answer": "Topical metronidazole", "options": {"A": "Topical corticosteroids", "B": "Topical benzoyl peroxide", "C": "Oral isotretinoin", "D": "Topical metronidazole"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and history, it is essential to consider the potential causes of her condition, which includes a possible allergic or inflammatory etiology given the erythema, papules, and telangiectasias. The fact that she has tried various sunscreens without relief suggests an issue with her skin's response to sunlight.\n\nThe patient's stress levels could be contributing to her symptoms, as stress is known to exacerbate conditions like acne vulgaris and rosacea. However, the presence of erythema on the nose, chin, and medial cheeks, along with scant papules and telangiectasias, suggests a more systemic issue rather than just localized acne.\n\nConsidering these factors, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\nA. Topical corticosteroids: While topical corticosteroids can be effective for mild to moderate rosacea, they may not address the underlying cause of this patient's symptoms and could potentially worsen her condition if used excessively or without proper medical supervision.\n\nB. Topical benzoyl peroxide: Benzoyl peroxide is commonly used in the treatment of acne vulgaris but might not be sufficient for addressing the erythema and papules seen in this patient.\n\nC. Oral isotretinoin: Isotretinoin is a powerful oral retinoid that is typically reserved for severe, resistant, or life-threatening cases of rosacea. Given the patient's age (40) and the severity of her symptoms, oral isotretinoin might be considered an option, but it carries significant risks, including birth defects if used during pregnancy.\n\nD. Topical metronidazole: Metronidazole is an antibiotic that can be effective against mild to moderate acne vulgaris and rosacea. It may also have anti-inflammatory properties, which could help with the erythema and papules seen in this patient.\n\nGiven the potential benefits of topical metronidazole for addressing the erythema and papules without the significant risks associated with oral isotretinoin, it appears to be the most appropriate initial treatment option for this patient. However, it is essential to note that further evaluation and possibly a prescription-strength formulation may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and optimize treatment.", "pred_ans": "D"}

These symptoms are suggestive of a hormonal imbalance, particularly related to growth hormone (GH) or cortisol.\n\nThe fact that he can no longer wear his normal-sized boots suggests a decrease in GH levels, as GH stimulates growth in children and adolescents. The recent start of lisinopril for high blood pressure is also relevant, as it may be affecting the body's ability to produce hormones, including GH.\n\nGiven these symptoms, let's consider the options:\n\nA. Liver - While the liver produces many important hormones, such as thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), it is not directly involved in the production of growth hormone.\n\nB.

He has poor muscle tone.\n\nWhich of the following additional findings would most likely be seen in this patient?", "answer": "Hypogonadism", "options": {"A": "Ataxia", "B": "Hemihyperplasia", "C": "Hypogonadism", "D": "Webbed neck"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the clinical presentation of this six-year-old male, including frequent temper tantrums, weight gain despite limited food intake, poor muscle tone, and developmental delays in counting objects and naming letters, it is essential to consider potential underlying conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms.\n\nThe patient's parents have already identified several issues related to his eating habits (weight gain) and behavior (temper tantrums), which are likely contributing factors. However, the additional findings listed in the options should be considered in the context of possible developmental delays or other medical conditions that could explain the patient's overall presentation.\n\nOption A, Ataxia, is a condition characterized by a lack of muscle coordination which can lead to difficulties with walking and balance. While it is not directly related to the symptoms described, ataxia can sometimes be associated with neurological disorders, including those affecting the brain or spinal cord.\n\nOption B, Hemihyperplasia, refers to an overgrowth of one side of the body, often seen in conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome. This condition is characterized by developmental delays, feeding difficulties, and obesity, which aligns with the patient's presentation.\n\nOption C, Hypogonadism, refers to a condition where the gonads (testes or ovaries) do not produce enough sex hormones, leading to delayed puberty. While this could potentially contribute to some of the symptoms described, it is less directly related to the overall clinical picture presented.\n\nOption D, Webbed neck, is a physical characteristic often associated with Down syndrome. However, in the context of developmental delays and obesity, other conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome or other genetic disorders should be considered first.\n\nConsidering these options in light of the patient's presentation, Option B (Hemihyperplasia) appears to be the most likely additional finding that would explain some of the symptoms described. This is because hemihyperplasia can lead to developmental delays and obesity, which align with the patient's clinical presentation.", "pred_ans": "B"}
{"idx": 1957, "question": "A 72-year-old and his caregiver present for a follow-up after a transthoracic needle biopsy of one of the large lesions in his chest was reported as non-small cell carcinoma of the lung. Previously, a chest CT revealed numerous nodules in the lungs bilaterally. The chest CT was ordered after the patient experienced a persistent cough with hemoptysis and a history of multiple episodes of pneumonia over the past year. The patient has a history of dementia and is a poor historian. The caregiver states that the patient has no history of smoking and that he was a lawyer before he retired, 10 years ago. The caregiver can only provide a limited medical history, but states that the patient sees another doctor \u201cto monitor his prostate\u201d. Which of the following is true regarding the pathogenesis of the nodules seen in this patient?", "answer": "Tumors seeded via the pulmonary arteries", "options": {"A": "Aspergillus infection leading to a formation of a 'fungus ball'", "B": "Malignant transformation of neuroendocrine cells", "C": "Proliferation of cells that contain glands that produce mucin", "D": "Tumors seeded via the pulmonary arteries"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nFirst, let's consider the patient's symptoms and medical history:\n\n- The patient has a history of dementia, which may indicate cognitive impairment or other neurological conditions.\n- He experienced persistent cough with hemoptysis, suggesting respiratory issues.\n- A history of multiple episodes of pneumonia over the past year could be related to his lung condition.\n- His previous chest CT revealed numerous nodules in the lungs bilaterally.\n\nGiven these symptoms and findings, we need to consider the possible pathogenesis of the nodules:\n\nA. Aspergillus infection leading to a formation of a 'fungus ball' - This is unlikely as there's no mention of an Aspergillus infection or any other fungal-related condition in the patient's history.\n\nB. Malignant transformation of neuroendocrine cells - While this could be a possibility for some lung lesions, it doesn't directly relate to the patient's symptoms and medical history.\n\nC. Proliferation of cells that contain glands that produce mucin - This option is more likely related to the patient's symptoms. The presence of multiple nodules in the lungs bilaterally, particularly with hemoptysis (coughing up blood), could be indicative of a lung condition that involves glandular tissue.\n\nD. Tumors seeded via the pulmonary arteries - While this is a possibility for some lung lesions, it doesn't directly relate to the patient's symptoms and medical history.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms and medical history, option C (Proliferation of cells that contain glands that produce mucin) is the most likely explanation.

{"idx": 1958, "question": "A 21-year-old African American female presents to her primary care physician reporting a history of excess hair growth. She has to shave her face and chest on a regular basis. She is sexually active and uses condoms for protection. Her last period was two months ago and she reports having 5-6 menstrual periods per year at irregular intervals. She has no past medical history and takes no medications. She drinks socially and does not smoke. Her family history is notable for heart disease in her father and endometrial cancer in her mother. Her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/85 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 16/min. The physician considers starting the patient on a medication that is also indicated in the treatment of histoplasmosis. This medication primary acts by inhibiting which of the following proteins?", "answer": "Desmolase", "options": {"A": "Squalene epoxidase", "B": "Desmolase", "C": "Aromatase", "D": "5-alpha-reductase"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nFirst, let's consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient reports excess hair growth, particularly on her face and chest, which is a common symptom associated with hormonal imbalances, particularly an excess of androgens (male hormones). Her sexual activity and use of condoms suggest that she may be experiencing hirsutism, a condition characterized by excessive hair growth in women.\n\nThe patient's menstrual history is also relevant. She reports having 5-6 menstrual periods per year at irregular intervals, which suggests Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder common among women of African descent. PCOS is often associated with excess androgen levels, insulin resistance, and ovulatory dysfunction.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and medical history, it is likely that she has hirsutism due to an excess of androgens. The medication considered for this condition is typically a glucocorticoid, which inhibits the production of androgens by the adrenal glands.\n\nThe correct answer choice is A. Squalene epoxidase, as glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, inhibit the enzyme 17,20-desmolase (also known as squalene epoxidase), which is involved in the biosynthesis of androgens from cholesterol. By inhibiting this enzyme, glucocorticoids reduce the production of androgens, leading to a decrease in excess hair growth.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n* B. Desmolase (also known as 17,20-desmolase) is actually an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of estrogens, not androgens.\n* C. Aromatase is an enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens, but it is not directly inhibited by glucocorticoids.\n* D. 5-alpha-reductase is an enzyme involved in the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent form of androgen that contributes to hirsutism.", "pred_ans": "A"}
{"idx": 1963, "question": "A 35-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after the onset of severe dyspnea. On arrival, she is unresponsive. Her pulse is 160/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 60/30 mm Hg. CT angiography of the chest shows extensive pulmonary embolism in both lungs. She is given a drug that inhibits both thrombin and factor Xa. Which of the following medications was most likely administered?", "answer": "Unfractioned heparin", "options": {"A": "Ticagrelor", "B": "Apixaban", "C": "Unfractioned heparin", "D": "Fondaparinux"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo approach this question, let's break down the key elements and analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient presents with severe dyspnea (difficulty breathing) and is unresponsive upon arrival. These symptoms suggest acute respiratory distress or failure.\n\n2. **Vital Signs**: The patient has tachycardia (elevated heart rate), tachypnea (rapid respirations), and hypotension (low blood pressure). These signs indicate shock, which can be due to various causes including cardiac, respiratory, or vascular issues.\n\n3. **Diagnostic Findings**: CT angiography of the chest reveals extensive pulmonary embolism in both lungs. Pulmonary embolism is a known cause of acute respiratory distress and shock.\n\n4. **Treatment Goal**: The goal is to inhibit thrombin (a key enzyme in blood clot formation) and factor Xa, which are crucial for clot formation. This suggests we're looking for an anticoagulant that targets these pathways.\n\n5. **Medication Options**:\n   - A. Ticagrelor: An antiplatelet medication used primarily to prevent platelet aggregation in conditions like acute coronary syndrome.\n   - B. Apixaban: An oral direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that inhibits factor Xa, making it a strong candidate for the described scenario.\n   - C. Unfractioned heparin: An anticoagulant that works by activating antithrombin III and inhibiting thrombin and factor Xa. However, its use is typically more complex due to its need for frequent dosing and monitoring of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).\n   - D. Fondaparinux: A synthetic pentasaccharide that inhibits factor Xa without activating antithrombin III. It's often used in patients with atrial fibrillation or deep vein thrombosis.\n\nGiven the patient's presentation of acute respiratory distress and pulmonary embolism, the most likely medication administered would be one that directly addresses both clot formation (through inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa) and has a rapid onset of action to counteract shock. Fondaparinux is known for its efficacy in anticoagulation therapy with a more straightforward dosing regimen compared to unfractionated heparin, making it an attractive option.", "pred_ans": "D"}

This study is best described as which of the following?", "answer": "Ecological study", "options": {"A": "Case-control study", "B": "Ecological study", "C": "Case series", "D": "Double-blind clinical trial"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nThe study described is an ecological study, specifically a case-control study.\n\n- The investigators examined per capita income and rates of syphilis in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston.\n- This suggests that the researchers are looking at the relationship between two variables (per capita income and syphilis rates) to identify potential associations or correlations.\n- However, the fact that they found a higher number of new cases of syphilis was higher in low-income neighborhoods implies that the relationship is not causal but rather observational. This is characteristic of an ecological study.\n\nIn particular, this type of study is known as a case-control study because it involves comparing individuals with a specific outcome (cases) to those without the outcome (controls), looking back in time to identify potential exposures or risk factors.

{"idx": 1981, "question": "A 61-year-old woman presents to her physician with foot tingling, numbness, and pain. She describes her pain as constant and burning and gives it 5 out of 10 on the visual analog pain scale. She also recalls several falls due to the numbness in her feet. She was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and diabetic retinopathy 5 years ago. Since then, she takes metformin 1000 mg twice daily and had no follow-up visits to adjust her therapy. Her weight is 110 kg (242.5 lb), and her height is 176 cm (5 ft. 7 in). The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate is 72/min, respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.6\u00b0C (97.9\u00b0F). The patient has increased adiposity in the abdominal region with stretch marks. The respiratory examination is within normal limits. The cardiovascular exam is significant for a bilateral carotid bruit. The neurological examination shows bilateral decreased ankle reflex, symmetrically decreased touch sensation and absent vibration sensation in both feet up to the ankle. The gait is mildly ataxic. The Romberg test is positive with a tendency to fall to both sides, and significant worsening on eye closure.

The presence of a bilateral carotid bruit suggests potential vascular disease, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.\n\nFirstly, considering the patient's pain, we should look for medications that are effective in managing neuropathic pain, as suggested by the decreased ankle reflexes, symmetrically decreased touch sensation, absent vibration sensation, and positive Romberg test. Among the options provided:\n\n- Morphine (A) is a potent opioid analgesic commonly used for severe pain but may not be the best choice given the patient's history of falls due to numbness in her feet.\n- Tramadol (B) is an opioid analgesic that can provide effective pain relief, including neuropathic pain. However, it may have more side effects compared to morphine and could potentially worsen respiratory depression if not used carefully.\n- Topiramate (C) is an antiepileptic medication that has been shown to be effective in managing chronic pain, including neuropathic pain. It can also help with the management of diabetic retinopathy due to its anti-inflammatory properties.\n- Nortriptyline (D) is a tricyclic antidepressant that can provide some analgesia but may not be sufficient for this patient's neuropathic pain.\n\nConsidering the patient's vascular risk factors and the need to manage both her pain and diabetic retinopathy, Topiramate (C) emerges as the most appropriate choice.

The symptoms described, such as cough, fever, somnolence, leg pain, and crackles over the right lung base on chest X-ray, are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nThe vaccine that could have prevented the boy from acquiring this infection is likely a live attenuated vaccine. Live vaccines contain weakened or attenuated forms of the virus or bacteria, which cannot cause disease in healthy individuals but can still trigger an immune response and provide protection against future infections.\n\nLive vaccines are typically used for diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), varicella (chickenpox), and influenza. They work by introducing a small amount of the virus or bacteria into the body, which triggers an immune response that provides long-term immunity against future infections.\n\nIn contrast, inactivated vaccines contain killed or denatured forms of the virus or bacteria, which cannot cause disease but still stimulate an immune response. Conjugate vaccines are another type of vaccine that combines a weakened form of the bacteria with a carrier protein to enhance the immune response. Toxoid vaccines, on the other hand, contain inactivated toxins derived from bacteria, such as diphtheria or tetanus.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings suggestive of pertussis, a live attenuated vaccine is the most likely candidate for preventing this infection.\n\nThe rapid strep test being negative does not necessarily rule out the possibility of pertussis, but it suggests that the boy may have been infected with Bordetella pertussis before testing.
