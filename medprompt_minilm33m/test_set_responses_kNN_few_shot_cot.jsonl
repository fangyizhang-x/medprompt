{"question": "A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?", "answer": "Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake", "options": {"A": "Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report", "B": "Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake", "C": "Report the physician to the ethics committee", "D": "Refuse to dictate the operative report"}, "meta_info": "step1", "answer_idx": "B", "metamap_phrases": ["junior orthopaedic surgery resident", "completing", "carpal tunnel repair", "department chairman", "attending physician", "case", "resident", "cuts", "flexor tendon", "tendon", "repaired", "complication", "attending", "resident", "patient", "fine", "need to report", "minor complication", "not", "patient", "not", "to make", "patient worry", "resident to leave", "complication out", "operative report", "following", "correct next action", "resident to take"], "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nThe correct course of action for the junior orthopaedic surgery resident in this scenario is:\n\nA. Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report.\n\nThis decision demonstrates a commitment to transparency, honesty, and respect for the patient's autonomy. By disclosing the mistake, the resident ensures that the patient is fully informed about any potential complications or risks associated with the procedure, which can help them make an informed decision about their care.\n\nThe attending physician's request not to disclose the error is inappropriate because it disregards the patient's right to know about any potential complications and may lead to unnecessary anxiety or distress. The resident has a duty to report any significant errors or complications that could impact patient care, as outlined in professional ethics guidelines such as those from the American Medical Association (AMA) or the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS).\n\nThe attending physician's request to leave the complication out of the operative report is also inappropriate because it prioritizes his own interests over the patient's well-being. By not disclosing the error, the resident may be putting the patient at risk by failing to provide them with accurate and complete information about their care.\n\nReporting the physician to the ethics committee (C) might be a necessary step if the attending physician's behavior is deemed unethical or unprofessional, but it is not the immediate next action for the junior orthopaedic surgery resident in this scenario. Refusing to dictate the operative report (D) may seem like an extreme measure, but it is actually the most appropriate course of action.", "pred_ans": "A"}
{"question": "A 67-year-old man with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of ringing sensation in his ear. He received this first course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 week ago. Pure tone audiometry shows a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB. The expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to which of the following actions?", "answer": "Cross-linking of DNA", "options": {"A": "Inhibition of proteasome", "B": "Hyperstabilization of microtubules", "C": "Generation of free radicals", "D": "Cross-linking of DNA"}, "meta_info": "step1", "answer_idx": "D", "metamap_phrases": ["67 year old man", "transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder", "physician", "2-day history", "ringing sensation", "ear", "received", "first course", "neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 week", "Pure tone audiometry shows", "sensorineural hearing loss", "dB", "expected beneficial effect", "drug", "caused", "patient's symptoms", "most likely due to", "following actions"], "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's history of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and his recent initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, it is essential to consider how this treatment may have affected his hearing.\n\nThe patient reports a ringing sensation in his ear 2 days after starting chemotherapy. This symptom is consistent with ototoxicity, which can occur as a side effect of certain medications used in cancer treatment.\n\nPure tone audiometry shows a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB, indicating significant damage to the inner ear or auditory nerve. The beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms would likely be aimed at mitigating ototoxicity.\n\nConsidering the options provided:\n\nA. Inhibition of proteasome - Proteasomes are involved in protein degradation and have been implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. However, their inhibition is not typically associated with ototoxicity.\n\nB. Hyperstabilization of microtubules - Microtubules play a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of cells. Their hyperstabilization would likely lead to cell death or dysfunction, rather than ototoxicity.\n\nC. Generation of free radicals - Free radicals can cause oxidative stress and damage to cellular components, including DNA and proteins. However, their generation is not directly linked to ototoxicity in this context.\n\nD. Cross-linking of DNA - This action would lead to the formation of covalent bonds between DNA strands, which can disrupt normal DNA replication and transcription processes. The cross-linking of DNA has been implicated in various cellular processes, including cell death and DNA damage. In the context of ototoxicity, this mechanism could potentially explain why chemotherapy agents like cisplatin are associated with hearing loss.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and the potential mechanisms involved, the most likely beneficial effect of the drug that caused his hearing loss is cross-linking of DNA.", "pred_ans": "D"}
