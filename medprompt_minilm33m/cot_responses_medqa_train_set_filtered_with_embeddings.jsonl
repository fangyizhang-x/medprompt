{"idx": 14, "question": "A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician because of coughing and fatigue during the past 2 years. In the morning, the cough is productive of white phlegm. She becomes short of breath walking up a flight of stairs. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She has recently retired from working as a nurse at a homeless shelter. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. Current medications include ramipril and fenofibrate. Her temperature is 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), respirations are 24/min, pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Scattered wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops but heart sounds are distant. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?", "answer": "Progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow", "options": {"A": "Chronic decrease in pulmonary compliance", "B": "Local accumulation of kinins", "C": "Progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow", "D": "Incremental loss of functional residual capacity\n\""}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's history and physical examination findings, we can analyze each option to determine the most likely underlying cause of her symptoms.\n\nFirstly, let's consider the patient's symptoms: coughing and fatigue for 2 years, productive white phlegm in the morning, shortness of breath walking up a flight of stairs, and scattered wheezing and rhonchi throughout both lung fields. These findings suggest an obstructive lung disease process.\n\nOption A, \"Chronic decrease in pulmonary compliance,\" is unlikely because the patient's symptoms are more suggestive of airway obstruction rather than decreased lung volume.\n\nOption B, \"Local accumulation of kinins,\" might be relevant to some respiratory conditions but is not directly related to the patient's primary symptoms and physical examination findings.\n\nOption C, \"Progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow,\" aligns with the patient's symptoms of productive coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. This option also takes into account the patient's history as a nurse, which may have exposed her to respiratory irritants or pathogens that could contribute to an obstructive lung disease process.\n\nOption D, \"Incremental loss of functional residual capacity,\" is more relevant to conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but does not directly explain the patient's acute symptoms and physical examination findings.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow, which could be due to a variety of causes including chronic bronchitis or COPD. However, given the patient's history as a nurse and her exposure to respiratory irritants, we should also consider occupational lung disease.", "pred_ans": "C", "embedding": [0.026126547, -0.00320225,

About 12 hours after presentation, she gives birth to a 6 lb 15 oz baby boy with APGAR scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Which of the following structures is responsible for inhibition of female internal genitalia?", "answer": "Sertoli cells", "options": {"A": "Spermatogonia", "B": "Allantois", "C": "Syncytiotrophoblast", "D": "Sertoli cells"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo address this question, we need to consider the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy and childbirth, as well as the structures involved in female reproductive physiology.\n\nFirstly, let's review the key points from the scenario:\n\n1. The patient is a 40-week-gestational-age woman who presents with a vaginal rush of water (dyspareunia) followed by delivery.\n2. She has been at 4 cm dilated and 80% effaced for approximately 12 hours, indicating active labor.\n3. Fetal heart tracing shows a normal fetal heart rate with variable decelerations, suggesting that the fetus is adapting to the changes in uterine contractions during labor.\n4. The baby is born with APGAR scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively, indicating good health.\n\nNow, let's consider the structures involved in female reproductive physiology:\n\nA. Spermatogonia - These are the cells that give rise to sperm in males. They are not directly involved in female reproductive physiology or the inhibition of female internal genitalia during labor.\n\nB. Allantois - This is a structure in the embryonic development of birds and reptiles, but it is not relevant to human female reproductive physiology.\n\nC. Syncytiotrophoblast - This is a layer of cells that forms the outermost layer of the trophoblasts in the placenta. While it plays a crucial role in fetal development and pregnancy, it is not directly involved in the inhibition of female internal genitalia during labor.\n\nD. Sertoli cells - These are a type of cell found in the seminiferous tubules of the testes in males, where they support the development of sperm cells. In females, Sertoli cells play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the oocyte (egg) and the early stages of embryonic development.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that the structure responsible for inhibition of female internal genitalia during labor is D. Sertoli cells. These cells help to maintain the integrity of the oocyte and prevent it from being released prematurely into the uterine cavity, which could lead to complications such as preterm birth or miscarriage.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [0.028120415, -0.00546436, -0.061193388, 0.011975327, 0.03427527, -0.08411033, 0.009076152, 0.024089867, -0.05108704, 0.041923963, 0.06365402, -0.06077552,

{"idx": 58, "question": "A 26-year-old G1P0 woman at 32-weeks gestation presents for follow-up ultrasound. She was diagnosed with gestational diabetes during her second trimester, but admits to poor glucose control and non-adherence to insulin therapy. Fetal ultrasound reveals an asymmetric, enlarged interventricular septum, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and significantly reduced ejection fraction. Which of the following is the most appropriate step in management after delivery?", "answer": "Medical management", "options": {"A": "Emergent open fetal surgery", "B": "Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging", "C": "Cardiac catheterization", "D": "Medical management"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and ultrasound findings, this 26-year-old G1P0 woman is at high risk for adverse outcomes due to her gestational diabetes and poor glucose control. The presence of an asymmetric interventricular septum, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and significantly reduced ejection fraction indicates severe cardiac disease.\n\nAfter delivery, the most appropriate step in management would be to initiate medical management to stabilize the mother's cardiovascular status and prevent further deterioration. This is because:\n\n1. **Gestational diabetes can lead to maternal complications**: Poor glucose control during pregnancy increases the risk of developing gestational diabetes-related complications, such as hypertension, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction.\n2. **Cardiac disease requires close monitoring**: The presence of cardiac abnormalities necessitates regular follow-up to ensure that the mother's condition does not worsen between pregnancies.\n3. **Medical management is a standard approach**: For women with severe cardiac disease, medical therapy is often the most effective way to manage symptoms and prevent further complications.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most appropriate step in management after delivery would be to initiate medical management, which may include:\n\n- **Insulin therapy** to control blood glucose levels\n- **Beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors** to reduce blood pressure and improve cardiac function\n- **Fibrinolytic agents** to manage left ventricular outflow tract obstruction\n\nThe other options are not appropriate as the initial step in management after delivery:\n\n- Emergent open fetal surgery (A) is typically reserved for specific indications, such as severe fetal anomalies or distress.\n- Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (B) may be useful in evaluating cardiac function and identifying any potential complications, but it is not a substitute for medical management.\n- Cardiac catheterization (C) may be necessary to evaluate the severity of cardiac disease and guide treatment, but it is typically performed after initial stabilization with medical therapy.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [0.048070453, 0.0065155793, 0.001736602, 0.05177942, -0.038818073, 0.011217373, -0.025482977, 0.027020898, -0.108095214, -0.0651831,

{"idx": 74, "question": "A 16-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her friends who say that she took a whole bottle of her mom\u2019s medication. They do not know which medication it was she ingested. The patient is slipping in and out of consciousness and is unable to offer any history. Her temperature is 39.6\u00b0C (103.2\u00b0F), the heart rate is 135/min, the blood pressure is 178/98 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 16/min. On physical examination, there is significant muscle rigidity without tremor or clonus. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?", "answer": "Dantrolene", "options": {"A": "Naloxone", "B": "Dantrolene", "C": "Fenoldopam", "D": "Cyproheptadine"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the clinical presentation of this 16-year-old girl, the most likely diagnosis is a severe case of hyperthermic intoxication due to ingestion of an opioid or other central nervous system depressant. The key features that point towards this diagnosis include:\n\n1. **Severe hyperthermia**: Her temperature is 39.6\u00b0C (103.2\u00b0F), which indicates a high fever.\n2. **Muscle rigidity without tremor or clonus**: This suggests that the patient's muscles are stiff and rigid, but there is no evidence of neurological deficits such as tremors or muscle weakness.\n3. **Cardiovascular instability**: Her blood pressure is 178/98 mm Hg, which indicates hypertension, and her heart rate is 135/min, which is tachycardic.\n\nConsidering these features, the best course of treatment would be to address the underlying cause of hyperthermia and manage the cardiovascular instability. Among the options provided:\n\n- **A. Naloxone**: This is an opioid antagonist used to reverse opioid overdose. While it may help alleviate some symptoms, it does not address the underlying cause of hyperthermia or the cardiovascular instability.\n- **B. Dantrolene**: This is a muscle relaxant that can be used to treat malignant hyperthermia and other conditions involving excessive muscle contraction. However, its use in this case is less clear-cut, as there are no specific indications for dantrolene in this scenario.\n- **C. Fenoldopam**: This is a dopamine receptor agonist used to manage severe hypertension and acute heart failure. It does not address the underlying cause of hyperthermia or the cardiovascular instability.\n- **D. Cyproheptadine**: This is an antihistamine with sedative properties, which can be used to treat anxiety and insomnia. While it may have some benefits in this case, its use as a first-line treatment for severe hyperthermia and cardiovascular instability is not recommended.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation of severe hyperthermia and cardiovascular instability, the best course of treatment would be to administer **Bantamuline (Dantrolene)**, which can help reduce muscle rigidity and alleviate some symptoms. However, it's essential to note that this medication should only be used under close medical supervision, as its use in severe cases like this requires careful consideration and monitoring.",

Her attention span is limited and she exhibits emotional lability. This patient\u2019s condition is most likely due to a defect in an enzyme that metabolizes which of the following compounds?", "answer": "Porphobilinogen", "options": {"A": "Coproporphyrinogen III", "B": "Hydroxymethylbilane", "C": "Porphobilinogen", "D": "Protoporphyrin IX"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation of rapid onset sadness, emotional lability, confusion, disorientation, and limited attention span, along with her family history of psychosis, we can deduce that this patient likely suffers from Bipolar Disorder. The key to answering this question lies in identifying a metabolic defect that is associated with bipolar disorder.\n\nBipolar disorder is often linked to defects in the metabolism of porphyrins, which are a class of compounds involved in heme synthesis. Heme is an essential component of hemoglobin and myoglobin, playing a critical role in oxygen transport and energy production in cells.\n\nThe patient's past medical history of diagnostic laparoscopies for recurrent episodes of abdominal pain of unknown etiology could be related to her family history of psychosis, which may suggest a genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders. However, the most relevant connection to bipolar disorder is the metabolic defect associated with porphyrin metabolism.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Coproporphyrinogen III - This compound is involved in the breakdown of heme and is not directly linked to bipolar disorder.\nB. Hydroxymethylbilane - This compound is a precursor in the biosynthesis of heme, but it is not specifically associated with bipolar disorder.\nC. Porphobilinogen - This compound is an intermediate in the porphyrin pathway, which is relevant to heme synthesis and has been implicated in various disorders, including porphyria cutanea tarda, a condition that can cause abdominal pain and psychiatric symptoms.\nD. Protoporphyrin IX - While this compound is involved in heme synthesis, it is not specifically linked to bipolar disorder.\n\nGiven the patient's presentation of rapid onset sadness, emotional lability, confusion, disorientation, and limited attention span, along with her family history of psychosis, the most likely metabolic defect associated with her condition is a defect in porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS), an enzyme involved in the production of protoporphyrin IX.

{"idx": 85, "question": "A 5-year-old boy who recently emigrated from Nigeria is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of lower leg weakness, swallowing difficulty, and drooling of saliva. He has not yet received any childhood vaccinations. Two days after admission, the patient develops shortness of breath. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 64%. Despite resuscitative efforts, the patient dies of respiratory failure. At autopsy, examination of the spinal cord shows destruction of the anterior horn cells. Neurological examination of this patient would have most likely shown which of the following findings?", "answer": "Hyporeflexia", "options": {"A": "Positive Babinski sign", "B": "Hyporeflexia", "C": "Myoclonus", "D": "Pronator drift"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and autopsy findings, we can deduce that this patient has a mitochondrial disorder, specifically a form of myopathy or neuropathy associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations.\n\nThe key points from the case:\n\n1. **Lower leg weakness, swallowing difficulty, and drooling of saliva**: These symptoms suggest a neuromuscular or muscular disorder.\n2. **No vaccination history**: This increases the likelihood of an infectious cause for the patient's condition.\n3. **Shortness of breath on admission**: This could be due to respiratory muscle weakness or failure.\n4. **Death from respiratory failure despite resuscitative efforts**: This indicates severe respiratory compromise, likely due to a neuromuscular disorder affecting respiratory muscles.\n\nThe autopsy findings of destruction of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord are consistent with mitochondrial myopathies, which affect the mitochondria and can lead to muscle weakness and degeneration.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\n- **A. Positive Babinski sign**: This is typically seen in conditions affecting the central nervous system, such as cerebral palsy or upper motor neuron lesions.\n- **B. Hyporeflexia**: While hyporeflexia can be seen in various neurological conditions, it is not specific to mitochondrial disorders and does not directly relate to the autopsy findings of anterior horn cell destruction.\n- **C. Myoclonus**: This refers to sudden, involuntary muscle contractions. While myoclonus can occur in mitochondrial disorders, it is not a characteristic finding in this case.\n- **D. Pronator drift**: This is a sign of upper motor neuron damage, which is not consistent with the autopsy findings or the clinical presentation.\n\nGiven the evidence of mitochondrial involvement and the specific symptoms and autopsy findings, the most likely neurological examination finding would be related to muscle weakness and degeneration, such as:\n\n**B. Hyporeflexia**: This is because hyporeflexia can occur in various neuromuscular disorders, including those associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.", "pred_ans": "B", "embedding": [0.016258104,

{"idx": 95, "question": "A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of fatigue, dark urine, and a feeling of heaviness in her legs. Two weeks ago, she returned from a vacation to Brazil, where she spent most of her days exploring the city of Rio de Janeiro on foot. She also gained 3 kg (7 lb) during her vacation. She has systemic lupus erythematosus. Her only medication is hydroxychloroquine. Her temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 162/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 2+ pretibial edema bilaterally. Urinalysis shows:\nBlood 3+\nProtein 1+\nRBC 6\u20138/hpf with dysmorphic features\nRBC casts numerous\nWBC 8/hpf\nWBC casts rare\nBacteria negative\nWhich of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's leg findings?\"", "answer": "Salt retention", "options": {"A": "Venous insufficiency", "B": "Lymphatic obstruction", "C": "Renal protein loss", "D": "Salt retention"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can analyze the possible causes step by step:\n\n1. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Background**: The patient has a history of SLE, which is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the kidneys. However, in this case, her symptoms are more localized to her legs.\n\n2. **Recent Travel and Weight Gain**: The patient recently returned from Brazil, where she spent most of her time on foot, and gained weight during her vacation. This could be relevant because it may indicate a possible cause related to her recent travel or lifestyle changes.\n\n3. **Physical Examination Findings**:\n   - 2+ pretibial edema bilaterally: Edema in the lower legs is often associated with kidney problems.\n   - Urinalysis shows blood, protein, and RBC casts: These findings indicate renal involvement.\n   - WBCs are present but rare: This suggests that the inflammation is not as severe as it could be.\n\n4. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - Given the patient's SLE history and recent travel to Brazil, a possible cause related to her travel or lifestyle changes needs to be considered.\n   - Venous insufficiency (A) might explain some of the findings but does not fully account for the renal involvement.\n   - Lymphatic obstruction (B) could also contribute to edema but is less likely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.\n   - Renal protein loss (C) would be more consistent with a nephrotic syndrome, which is not indicated by the presence of RBC casts or significant hematuria.\n   - Salt retention (D) can lead to edema and renal impairment but does not directly explain the patient's symptoms.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Considering the patient's SLE history, recent travel, weight gain, and physical examination findings, the most likely cause of her leg findings is lymphatic obstruction. This could be related to a condition such as lymphedema, which can occur in patients with SLE due to lymph node involvement or other factors.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [-0.044462204,

{"idx": 99, "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?", "answer": "245 / (245 + 10)", "options": {"A": "245 / (245 + 10)", "B": "245 / (245 + 5)", "C": "240 / (240 + 5)", "D": "240 / (240 + 15)"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nFirst, let's identify the given information:\n- The test is used to screen for AIDS in patients with confirmed AIDS.\n- 250 patients with confirmed AIDS were enrolled in the study.\n- 240 out of these 250 patients tested positive on the novel screening examination.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the NPV (Positive Predictive Value) of this novel test. The NPV is defined as the proportion of true positives among all positive results.\n\nTo calculate the NPV, we first need to determine the number of false negatives (patients without AIDS who tested positive). Since 5 out of 250 patients in the control group did not have AIDS and tested positive, we can assume that these 5 are also false negatives. However, this is an assumption, as it's possible they might actually have AIDS.\n\nLet's calculate the number of true positives (patients with confirmed AIDS who tested positive) using the information from the study:\n- Total patients with confirmed AIDS = 250\n- Patients with confirmed AIDS and positive test result = 240\n\nThe proportion of true positives among all positive results can be calculated as follows:\n\nNPV = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)\n\nSince we don't have the exact number of false positives, let's calculate it using the given information:\n- Total patients without AIDS = 250 - 250 = 0\n- Patients with confirmed AIDS and negative test result = 5\n\nThe proportion of true negatives among all negative results can be calculated as follows:\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n\nSince we don't have the exact number of false negatives, let's calculate it using the given information:\n- Total patients without AIDS = 250\n- Patients with confirmed AIDS and positive test result = 240\n\nThe proportion of true positives among all positive results can be calculated as follows:\n\nNPV = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)\n\nUsing the formula for NPV, we get:\n\nNPV = 240 / (240 + 5) = 240 / 245 \u2248 0.98", "pred_ans": "A", "embedding": [0.042625666, 0.082340814, -0.055416014, -0.020083817,

The Parkland formula is used for calculating the amount of fluids needed for resuscitation in burn patients, but it assumes a certain percentage of total body water (TBW) loss, which may not accurately reflect the patient's actual fluid needs. While it can provide an estimate, it's not the most reliable method.\n\nB. Blood pressure is an important indicator of circulatory status, and hypotension (low blood pressure) can be a sign of inadequate fluid resuscitation. However, it may not directly indicate the adequacy of fluid infusion in terms of volume or rate.\n\nC. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) measures the pressure in the left atrium, which reflects the pressure in the pulmonary capillaries. It's a useful indicator of right heart function and can provide information about fluid overload or congestion. However, it may not directly indicate the adequacy of fluid infusion for burn patients.\n\nD. Urinary output is an important indicator of renal perfusion and can be used to assess the adequacy of fluid resuscitation in terms of volume status. In burn patients, adequate urinary output (typically >0.5 mL/kg/hour) is often used as a marker of sufficient fluid infusion.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate method to verify adequate fluid infusion in this patient with severe chemical burns would be to assess urinary output.

{"idx": 149, "question": "A 14-year-old boy presents as a new patient to your practice. While conducting your physical exam, you observe the findings depicted in Figures A and B. Which of the following additional findings would most likely be found in this patient?", "answer": "Iris hamartomas", "options": {"A": "The presence of ash-leaf spots", "B": "A family history of seizures and mental retardation", "C": "Iris hamartomas", "D": "A white tuft of scalp hair since birth"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the information provided, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Age and Presentation**: The patient is a 14-year-old boy presenting to your practice. This age group can be relevant for certain conditions that are more common in adolescents.\n\n2. **Observations from Figures A and B**: Although we don't have direct access to Figures A and B, the description of them suggests some sort of skin or eye condition. The presence of ash-leaf spots (A) is a key finding often associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which can also present in children.\n\n3. **Considering NF1**: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is characterized by multiple cafe-au-lait macules, freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions, and various other features such as iris hamartomas, neurofibromas, and Lisch nodules. The presence of ash-leaf spots (A) strongly suggests NF1.\n\n4. **Eliminating Other Options**:\n   - B. A family history of seizures and mental retardation is not directly supported by the information provided.\n   - C. Iris hamartomas are a common feature in neurofibromatosis type 1, but they can also be found in other conditions like von Hippel-Lindau disease or as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes.\n   - D. A white tuft of scalp hair since birth is more characteristic of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which typically presents with a different set of features, including ash-leaf spots.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the presence of ash-leaf spots and considering the age of the patient, the most likely additional finding in this case would be iris hamartomas, as they are strongly associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.", "pred_ans": "C", "embedding": [-0.002425015, 0.12432057, 0.06805494, -0.018731246, -0.004629474, -0.005782936, -0.025220381, 0.092188865, -0.0847674, 0.022225957,

{"idx": 174, "question": "A 65-year-old male with a history of CHF presents to the emergency room with shortness of breath, lower leg edema, and fatigue. He is diagnosed with acute decompensated congestive heart failure, was admitted to the CCU, and treated with a medication that targets beta-1 adrenergic receptors preferentially over beta-2 adrenergic receptors. The prescribing physician explained that this medication would only be used temporarily as its efficacy decreases within one week due to receptor downregulation. Which of the following was prescribed?", "answer": "Dobutamine", "options": {"A": "Epinephrine", "B": "Isoproterenol", "C": "Norepinephrine", "D": "Dobutamine"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven that the patient has acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) and is being treated with a medication that targets beta-1 adrenergic receptors preferentially over beta-2 adrenergic receptors, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. The medication's mechanism of action suggests it is a beta-blocker.\n2. Beta-blockers are known to have a negative inotropic effect (decrease contractility) and chronotropic effect (slowing heart rate), which would exacerbate symptoms of CHF such as shortness of breath, lower leg edema, and fatigue.\n3. The fact that the medication's efficacy decreases within one week due to receptor downregulation supports this deduction.\n\nConsidering these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Epinephrine - This is a catecholamine with both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic effects. It would increase heart rate and contractility, which would worsen CHF symptoms.\nB. Isoproterenol - This is also a beta-adrenergic agonist that primarily stimulates beta-2 receptors. Like epinephrine, it would increase heart rate and contractility, exacerbating CHF symptoms.\nC. Norepinephrine - This is another catecholamine with both alpha and beta adrenergic effects. It has a strong vasoconstrictive effect, which could worsen edema in the lower legs.\nD. Dobutamine - This medication is a beta-1 selective adrenergic agonist that also has some alpha-adrenergic activity. However, it has a unique property of having minimal effects on heart rate and contractility compared to other beta-blockers. It can be used as an inotrope (increases cardiac output) in the setting of acute decompensated CHF.\n\nGiven the patient's condition and the medication's mechanism of action, dobutamine is the most appropriate choice because it targets beta-1 adrenergic receptors preferentially over beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which aligns with the prescribed treatment. It also has a more favorable side effect profile compared to other options.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [0.025632966, -0.043273617, 0.014441091, 0.04752035, 0.051309384, 0.010551338, 0.019744707,

The patient's condition is most likely caused by failure of which of the following enzymatic reactions?\"", "answer": "Orotate to uridine 5'-monophosphate", "options": {"A": "Ornithine and carbamoylphosphate to citrulline", "B": "Hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate", "C": "Phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate", "D": "Orotate to uridine 5'-monophosphate"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. The patient is a 2-month-old boy with poor weight gain and irritability since delivery.\n2. He is at the 10th percentile for height and below the 5th percentile for weight.\n3. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor.\n4. Laboratory studies:\n   - Hemoglobin (Hb) level is 11.2 g/dL, which is lower than the normal range.\n   - Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 108 \u03bcm^3, indicating macrocytosis (large red blood cells).\n   - Serum ammonia levels are elevated at 26 \u03bcmol/L, which can be associated with various conditions including megaloblastic anemia.\n5. Peripheral blood smear shows:\n   - Macrocytosis of erythrocytes\n   - Hypersegmented neutrophils\n\nGiven these findings, the most likely diagnosis is megaloblastic anemia due to a deficiency in either folate or vitamin B12.\n\nThe patient's supplementation with folate and cobalamin (vitamin B12) has led to improvement in his hemoglobin concentration and mean corpuscular volume. This suggests that the initial cause of the anemia was related to a deficiency in one of these vitamins.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA. Ornithine and carbamoylphosphate to citrulline - This reaction is involved in the urea cycle.\nB. Hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate - This reaction is involved in purine metabolism.\nC. Phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate - This reaction is a key step in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.\nD. Orotate to uridine 5'-monophosphate - This reaction is involved in the synthesis of nucleic acids.\n\nThe correct answer is related to the metabolism of folate or vitamin B12, which are essential for DNA synthesis and repair. The most likely enzymatic reaction that would be affected by a deficiency in one of these vitamins is:\n\nD. Orotate to uridine 5'-monophosphate - This reaction is involved in the synthesis of nucleic acids, specifically in the transfer of orotic residues from orotate to UMP (uridine monophosphate) during DNA synthesis.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [-0.014815968, -0.025934275, -0.061645903, -0.005970632, -0.0533219, 0.022152308, 0.008364886, 0.03151941, -0.10060022, 0.041158363, -0.028888404,

{"idx": 186, "question": "A 55-year-old Chinese man presents to the office with a complaint of progressive unilateral nasal obstruction for 10 months. Though he was able to tolerate his symptoms at the beginning, he can\u2019t breathe properly through the obstructed nostril anymore. Also, a bloody nasal discharge has started recently through the occluded nostril. He also complains of double vision during the past 2 months but did not pay attention to it until now. Past medical history is insignificant except for occasional sore throats.\nHis vitals include: blood pressure of 120/88 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 14/min, pulse of 88/min, temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F).\nBlood analysis shows:\nHemoglobin 15 g/dL\nHematocrit 46%\nLeukocyte count 15000/mm3\nNeutrophils 72%\nLymphocytes 25%\nMonocytes 3%\nMean corpuscular volume 95 fL\nPlatelet count 350,000/mm3\nWhich of the following viral etiology is most likely associated with the development of this patient\u2019s condition?", "answer": "Epstein-Barr virus", "options": {"A": "Human papillomavirus", "B": "HIV", "C": "Epstein-Barr virus", "D": "Human T lymphotropic virus type I"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms, including progressive unilateral nasal obstruction, bloody nasal discharge, double vision (diplopia), and a history of occasional sore throats, we can consider several potential causes. However, considering the age of the patient and his presentation, we should also think about viral infections that are more common in older adults.\n\nThe key findings here include:\n\n- The patient's symptoms have progressed over 10 months, suggesting an ongoing infection.\n- The presence of bloody nasal discharge is a significant finding, which can be associated with several conditions but is particularly concerning for certain types of infections.\n- Double vision (diplopia) could be related to the involvement of cranial nerves or the compression of these nerves by the nasal obstruction.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\n- **Human Papillomavirus (HPV)**: While HPV can cause various respiratory and ocular symptoms, it is less commonly associated with progressive unilateral nasal obstruction and bloody nasal discharge.\n  \n- **HIV**: HIV infection can lead to a variety of opportunistic infections, but the presentation described here does not strongly suggest an HIV-related condition.\n\n- **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)**: EBV is known for causing infectious mononucleosis (mono), which can present with fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy. However, it typically does not cause progressive unilateral nasal obstruction or bloody nasal discharge.\n\n- **Human T Lymphotropic Virus Type I (HTLV-I)**: HTLV-I is associated with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and certain types of hairy cell leukemia. While these conditions can present with a variety of symptoms, they are less commonly linked to the specific combination of symptoms described in this patient.\n\nGiven the age of the patient, his presentation, and the lack of other significant findings, **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)** is the most likely viral etiology associated with the development of this patient's condition.

{"idx": 187, "question": "A 78-year-old man is brought in to the emergency department by ambulance after his wife noticed that he began slurring his speech and had developed facial asymmetry during dinner approximately 30 minutes ago. His past medical history is remarkable for hypertension and diabetes. His temperature is 99.1\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 154/99 mmHg, pulse is 89/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Neurologic exam reveals right upper and lower extremity weakness and an asymmetric smile. Which of the following is the next best step in management?", "answer": "CT head", "options": {"A": "Aspirin", "B": "CT head", "C": "CTA head", "D": "MRI brain"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation, which includes sudden onset of slurred speech and facial asymmetry, along with neurologic exam findings of right upper and lower extremity weakness and an asymmetric smile, the most likely diagnosis is a hemorrhagic stroke. The rapid progression to these symptoms suggests that the cause may be acute rather than subacute.\n\nThe next best step in management should aim to quickly identify whether there is a hemorrhage or another cause for the patient's symptoms. \n\nOption B (CT head) is the correct choice because it allows for immediate assessment of the brain for signs of hemorrhage, which could explain the patient's symptoms. A CT scan can be performed rapidly and is often the first imaging test ordered in acute stroke management.\n\nAspirin (A) may be considered as part of initial treatment to prevent further clot formation if a hemorrhagic stroke is suspected, but it does not address the need for immediate imaging.\n\nCarotid Angiography with CT Contrast (CTA head) and MRI Brain (D) are both important diagnostic tests that can provide detailed information about the brain. However, they may take longer to perform than a CT scan, which makes them less ideal as the first step in acute stroke management.", "pred_ans": "B", "embedding": [-0.011238153, 0.03447441,

Cryptorchidism increases the risk of testicular cancer because it can lead to an increased number of undescended testes, which are more likely to contain abnormal cells that can develop into cancer.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the patient's history of bilateral cryptorchidism and orchidopexy.

At this age, infants typically begin to show certain physical and cognitive milestones.\n\nFirstly, let's consider the options provided:\n\nA. Absence of asymmetric tonic neck reflex - This reflex is usually absent in infants until around 6-7 months of age. Since the patient is only 2 months old, it is unlikely that she has already developed this reflex.\n\nB. Monosyllabic babble - Infants typically start babbling with consonant-vowel combinations (e.g., \"ba,\" \"da\") by around 4-5 months and may begin to use single syllables like \"mama\" or \"dada\" by around 6-7 months. This option is plausible, but we need more information about the patient's vocal development.\n\nC. Smiles in response to face - Infants typically smile in response to their mother's face when they are around 2-3 months old. This is a classic sign of social and emotional development. Given that the patient appears well and has been exclusively breastfed, it is likely that she has already developed this skill.\n\nD. Stares at own hand - Infants typically stare at their hands or fingers when they are around 4-6 months old. While some infants may start to show interest in their hands earlier than others, staring at one's own hand is not a typical milestone for most infants until later in the first year.\n\nConsidering these options and the patient's age and feeding history, it is most likely that she has already developed the skill of smiling in response to her face.

{"idx": 231, "question": "A 17-year-old Latin American woman with no significant past medical history or family history presents to her pediatrician with concerns about several long-standing skin lesions. She notes that she has had a light-colored rash on her chest and abdomen that has been present for the last 2 years. The blood pressure is 111/81 mm Hg, pulse is 82/min, respiratory rate is 16/min, and temperature is 37.3\u00b0C (99.1\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous hypopigmented macules over her chest and abdomen. No lesions are seen on her palms or soles. When questioned, she states that these lesions do not tan like the rest of her skin when exposed to the sun. The remainder of her review of systems is negative. What is the most likely cause of these lesions?", "answer": "Malassezia yeast", "options": {"A": "Malassezia yeast", "B": "Cutaneous T cell lymphoma", "C": "TYR gene dysfunction in melanocytes", "D": "Treponema pallidum infection"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation with long-standing, hypopigmented macules on her chest and abdomen that do not tan upon sun exposure, we can consider several potential causes for these lesions.\n\nFirstly, let's evaluate option A. Malassezia yeast is a common cause of skin infections in individuals with compromised immune systems or those who have recently shaved, as it thrives in oily environments. However, the fact that the lesions do not tan upon sun exposure makes this less likely, as Malassezia yeast typically produces pigment.\n\nNext, let's consider option B. Cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a type of skin cancer that can present with hypopigmented macules, but it often has a different clinical presentation and does not typically respond to sun exposure.\n\nOption C, TYR gene dysfunction in melanocytes, refers to the condition oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1), which is characterized by reduced melanin production. While this can lead to hypopigmentation, it would more likely present with lighter skin rather than dark-colored lesions on the chest and abdomen.\n\nOption D, Treponema pallidum infection, refers to syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection that can cause a wide range of symptoms, including skin rashes. However, the typical presentation of syphilitic rashes is more widespread and often accompanied by other systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, and lymphadenopathy.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A, Malassezia yeast, is the most likely cause of this patient's lesions. This is because Malassezia yeast is a common skin commensal that can thrive in oily environments, leading to conditions like pityriasis versicolor (a type of dermatitis characterized by hypopigmented macules). The fact that these lesions do not tan upon sun exposure further supports this diagnosis.", "pred_ans": "A", "embedding": [-0.03089068, 0.01102678, 0.058010202, 0.074210644, 0.0096489, 0.024088355,

{"idx": 297, "question": "A 34-year-old man with AIDS comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of decreasing vision and seeing black spots in his right eye. He has no pain and the left eye is asymptomatic. He was treated for fungal esophagitis 6 months ago with fluconazole. He was diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma 2 years ago. Current medications include efavirenz, tenofovir, emtricitabine, azithromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, multivitamins, and a nutritional supplement. He is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 45 kg (99 lbs);BMI is 15.6 kg/m2. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 89/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows cervical lymphadenopathy. There are multiple violaceous plaques seen over his trunk and extremities. Fundoscopic examination shows granular yellow-white opacities around the retinal vessels and multiple areas of dot-blot hemorrhages. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 36/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "answer": "Cytomegalovirus retinitis", "options": {"A": "Cytomegalovirus retinitis", "B": "Toxoplasma retinitis", "C": "HIV retinopathy", "D": "Varicella zoster retinitis"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's history of AIDS, Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), and current symptoms such as decreasing vision, seeing black spots in one eye, and dot-blot hemorrhages on fundoscopic examination, we can consider several potential diagnoses. However, the presence of multiple violaceous plaques over his trunk and extremities is particularly noteworthy.\n\nFirstly, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis: This condition is a common complication in immunocompromised patients, including those with AIDS. CMV retinitis typically presents with vitiligo-like lesions on the retina and can cause significant vision loss if left untreated. The presence of violaceous plaques could be indicative of CMV infection.\n\nB. Toxoplasma retinitis: This is another opportunistic infection that can affect individuals with AIDS, particularly those who are immunocompromised. However, it typically presents with more focal lesions on the retina and may not cause widespread vitiligo-like changes.\n\nC. HIV retinopathy: While HIV-related retinopathy can cause various changes in the retina, including microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates, it is less likely to present with violaceous plaques or dot-blot hemorrhages.\n\nD. Varicella zoster retinitis: This condition typically affects individuals who have had chickenpox (varicella) in the past, often as a result of reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. It can cause vitiligo-like lesions on the retina and may present with dot-blot hemorrhages, but it is less likely to be associated with violaceous plaques.\n\nConsidering these factors, the presence of multiple violaceous plaques over his trunk and extremities, combined with the patient's history of AIDS, Kaposi's sarcoma, and current symptoms, makes option A (Cytomegalovirus retinitis) the most likely diagnosis. This is because CMV retinitis can cause widespread vitiligo-like lesions on the retina, including violaceous plaques, which are consistent with the patient's presentation.", "pred_ans": "A",

{"idx": 385, "question": "A 71-year-old man presents to the primary care clinic with non-specific complaints of fatigue and malaise. His past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, non-seminomatous testicular cancer, and hypercholesterolemia. He currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and he currently denies any illicit drug use. His vital signs include: temperature, 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F); blood pressure, 126/74 mm Hg; heart rate, 87/min; and respiratory rate, 17/min. On examination, his physician notices cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy bilaterally, as well as splenomegaly. The patient comments that he has lost 18.1 kg (40 lb) over the past 6 months without a change in diet or exercise, which he was initially not concerned about. The physician orders a complete blood count and adds on flow cytometry. Based on his age and overall epidemiology, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "answer": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia", "options": {"A": "Acute lymphocytic leukemia", "B": "Acute myelogenous leukemia", "C": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia", "D": "Hairy cell leukemia"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation with non-specific complaints of fatigue and malaise, along with his significant past medical history, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, non-seminomatous testicular cancer, and hypercholesterolemia, it is essential to consider the possibility of a hematological malignancy. The presence of cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy bilaterally, as well as splenomegaly, further supports this consideration.\n\nThe patient's recent significant weight loss without any change in diet or exercise also raises concerns for an underlying malignancy that could be causing his symptoms. Flow cytometry is a useful diagnostic tool in this context, as it can help identify abnormal cell populations that may indicate a hematological malignancy.\n\nConsidering the age of the patient and the overall epidemiology, we should evaluate the options provided:\n\nA. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) - ALL is more common in children and young adults, which does not align with this patient's age.\n\nB. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) - AML can occur at any age but is less common than ALL in patients over 60 years old.\n\nC. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) - CLL is the most common adult leukemia and typically presents with fatigue, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. It often occurs in older adults, which aligns with this patient's profile.\n\nD. Hairy cell leukemia - This rare type of leukemia can present with splenomegaly but is less likely to cause significant weight loss or lymphadenopathy without other symptoms.\n\nGiven the patient's age, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings, CLL is the most likely diagnosis due to its predilection for older adults and its association with non-specific complaints such as fatigue and malaise. The presence of cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy bilaterally and splenomegaly further supports this consideration.\n\nThe flow cytometry results are not explicitly mentioned in the question, but based on the clinical context, CLL is a strong candidate for the diagnosis.", "pred_ans": "C", "embedding": [0.041672807, 0.0069421027, -0.01583278, 0.01652166, -0.083646886, -0.03648814, 0.024326256,

Her symptoms began approximately 3 days ago, when she noticed pain with urination and mild blood in her urine. Earlier this morning she experienced chills, flank pain, and mild nausea. Approximately 1 month ago she had the \"flu\" that was rhinovirus positive and was treated with supportive management. She has a past medical history of asthma. She is currently sexually active and uses contraception inconsistently. She occasionally drinks alcohol and denies illicit drug use. Family history is significant for her mother having systemic lupus erythematosus. Her temperature is 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/87 mmHg, pulse is 101/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical examination, she appears uncomfortable. There is left-sided flank, suprapubic, and costovertebral angle tenderness. Urine studies are obtained and a urinalysis is demonstrated below:\n\nColor: Amber\npH: 6.8\nLeukocyte: Positive\nProtein: Trace\nGlucose: Negative\nKetones: Negative\nBlood: Positive\nNitrite: Positive\nLeukocyte esterase: Positive\nSpecific gravity: 1.015\n\nIf a renal biopsy is performed in this patient, which of the following would most likely be found on pathology?", "answer": "Suppurative inflammation with interstitial neutrophilic infiltration", "options": {"A": "Focal and segmental sclerosis of the glomeruli and mesangium", "B": "Mesangial proliferation", "C": "Normal appearing glomeruli", "D": "Suppurative inflammation with interstitial neutrophilic infiltration"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation, including fever, flank pain, mild nausea, chills, and hematuria (mild blood in urine), along with a history of \"flu\" that was rhinovirus positive, we can deduce several key points:\n\n1. **Recent upper respiratory infection**: The presence of leukocyte esterase and nitrite positivity in the urinalysis suggests an inflammatory process.\n2. **Hematuria**: This is indicative of kidney involvement, which could be due to various causes including glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or other conditions affecting the kidneys directly.\n3. **Asthma history**: While asthma itself does not directly cause renal pathology, it may contribute to systemic inflammation and potentially exacerbate certain conditions.\n\nConsidering these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\n- A. Focal and segmental sclerosis of the glomeruli and mesangium: This is a characteristic finding in conditions like membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), which can be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, SLE is not mentioned in the patient's history.\n- B. Mesangial proliferation: While mesangial proliferation can occur in various kidney diseases, it is less specific and does not directly correlate with the patient's recent upper respiratory infection or the presence of hematuria.\n- C. Normal appearing glomeruli: This would be unusual given the patient's symptoms and urinalysis results indicating inflammation.\n- D. Suppurative inflammation with interstitial neutrophilic infiltration: This option best aligns with the patient's presentation, including the recent upper respiratory infection, hematuria, and flank pain. The presence of leukocyte esterase and nitrite positivity in the urinalysis supports an inflammatory process, and suppurative inflammation is a common finding in conditions like pyelonephritis or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), which can follow a streptococcal infection.\n\nGiven the patient's recent upper respiratory infection and the presence of hematuria with inflammatory changes, PSGN is the most likely diagnosis. This condition typically presents with acute onset of flank pain, hematuria, and sometimes fever, making it consistent with this patient's symptoms.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [0.021499716,

{"idx": 398, "question": "A 31-year-old woman is brought to the physician because of increasing restlessness over the past 2 weeks. She reports that she continuously paces around the house and is unable to sit still for more than 10 minutes at a time. During this period, she has had multiple episodes of anxiety with chest tightness and shortness of breath. She was diagnosed with a psychotic illness 2 months ago. Her current medications include haloperidol and a multivitamin. She appears agitated. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The examination was interrupted multiple times when she became restless and began to walk around the room. To reduce the likelihood of the patient developing her current symptoms, a drug with which of the following mechanisms of action should have been prescribed instead of her current medication?", "answer": "5-HT2Areceptor antagonism", "options": {"A": "NMDA receptor antagonism", "B": "GABA receptor antagonism", "C": "5-HT2Areceptor antagonism", "D": "\u03b12 receptor antagonism"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo address this question, let's break down the key points and analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Patient's symptoms**: The patient is experiencing restlessness, anxiety, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and agitation. These symptoms are indicative of a psychotic episode, which can be triggered or exacerbated by certain medications.\n\n2. **Current medication**: The patient is taking haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication known to cause extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), such as restlessness, agitation, and Parkinsonian-like symptoms like bradykinesia and rigidity. EPS are a common side effect of first-generation (typical) antipsychotics.\n\n3. **Alternative medication**: The question asks for a drug with a different mechanism of action that should have been prescribed instead of haloperidol to reduce the likelihood of developing psychotic symptoms.\n\n4. **Mechanisms of action**:\n   - A. NMDA receptor antagonism: This is the mechanism of action of ketamine, which can induce dissociative states and hallucinations but is not typically used as a first-line treatment for psychosis.\n   - B. GABA receptor antagonism: This is the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines, which are primarily used to treat anxiety and insomnia. They do not have a primary role in treating psychotic symptoms.\n   - C. 5-HT2A receptor antagonism: This is the mechanism of action of risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic that has a lower risk of EPS compared to typical antipsychotics like haloperidol.\n   - D. \u03b12 receptor antagonism: This is the mechanism of action of clonidine and other \u03b12 agonists, which are primarily used for hypertension and ADHD. They do not have a primary role in treating psychotic symptoms.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that risperidone (atypical antipsychotic) has a lower risk of causing EPS compared to haloperidol (typical antipsychotic), it would be the most appropriate alternative medication for this patient, especially considering her history of psychosis and current symptoms.", "pred_ans": "C", "embedding":

{"idx": 407, "question": "A 29-year-old man is admitted to the emergency department following a motorcycle accident. The patient is severely injured and requires life support after splenectomy and evacuation of a subdural hematoma. Past medical history is unremarkable. The patient\u2019s family members, including wife, parents, siblings, and grandparents, are informed about the patient\u2019s condition. The patient has no living will and there is no durable power of attorney. The patient must be put in an induced coma for an undetermined period of time. Which of the following is responsible for making medical decisions for the incapacitated patient?", "answer": "The spouse", "options": {"A": "An older sibling", "B": "The parents", "C": "Legal guardian", "D": "The spouse"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nThe correct answer can be determined by understanding the legal and ethical implications of a patient's incapacity to make medical decisions.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to recognize that a patient who has undergone splenectomy (removal of their spleen) and has a subdural hematoma (a type of brain injury) requires life support. This situation implies that the patient is unable to provide informed consent for medical treatment due to their physical condition.\n\nThe legal framework in many jurisdictions provides for alternative decision-making authority in cases where a patient lacks capacity. The most common alternatives are:\n\n1.  **Living Will**: A document that outlines a person's wishes regarding life-sustaining treatments, such as organ donation or withdrawal of life support.\n2.  **Durable Power of Attorney (DPOA)**: An instrument that grants someone the authority to make decisions on behalf of another person who lacks capacity. In this case, the patient would not have a DPOA because they are incapacitated and unable to grant one.\n3.  **Spouse or Next of Kin**: The spouse or next of kin (e.g., parents, siblings) can be designated as the alternate decision-maker in the event that the patient lacks capacity.\n\nGiven these alternatives, it is clear that the spouse would be responsible for making medical decisions for the incapacitated patient.\n\nThe family members mentioned (older sibling, parents, siblings, and grandparents) are not typically considered alternative decision-makers in this scenario. While they may have a role in supporting the patient's loved ones, they do not possess the authority to make medical decisions on behalf of the patient.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [-0.029498188,

This can be achieved by performing a rapid sequence intubation (RSI) if the patient is unresponsive or not opening his eyes, which appears to be the case given his inability to open his eyes.\n\nRapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) involves administering two types of sedatives and an opioid to facilitate endotracheal intubation. This procedure is quick and effective in quickly securing the airway in emergency situations where time is critical.\n\nWhile other options, such as emergency open fracture repair or exploratory laparoscopy, may be considered in certain contexts, they are not the best initial step in this scenario due to the patient's unstable condition and the need for rapid assessment of life-threatening injuries. Intubation is a crucial step in managing this patient's airway and ensuring his safety until further diagnostic evaluation can be performed.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [0.03704505, 0.027643396,

{"idx": 417, "question": "A 50-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a chief complaint of chest pain that is squeezing in nature. He used to have similar symptoms in the past while playing tennis with his friends. Yesterday, while moving furniture in his new home, he experienced this pain that lasted for 20 minutes and radiated towards his jaw and shoulder. He has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and hypertension for over 10 years and regularly takes his medications. The pain is not associated with nausea, vomiting, food intake, sweating, or cough. On physical examination, the patient is not in acute distress. His blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg, heart rate is 80/min, respiratory rate is 16/min, temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.5\u00b0F), and BMI is 30 kg/m2. On physical examination, bilateral vesicular breath sounds are heard with absent chest tenderness. Cardiovascular examination reveals normal S1 and S2 without any abnormal sounds or murmur. Abdominal examination is within normal limit.

However, his current blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg, which is within the normal range.\n- The absence of nausea, vomiting, food intake, sweating, or cough suggests that the pain is not related to an acute gastrointestinal issue or a respiratory infection.\n- The patient's physical examination findings do not support the presence of musculoskeletal pain (e.g., absent chest tenderness).\n- The patient's age and symptoms are consistent with angina pectoris, which is typically caused by myocardial ischemia.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s condition is myocardial ischemia.

{"idx": 451, "question": "A 35-year-old G2P1 delivers a boy in the 40th week of gestation. The pregnancy was uncomplicated. The newborn had Apgar scores of 7 and 9 at the 1st and 5th minutes, respectively. On physical examination, the newborn is noted to have a left-sided cleft lip. The hard palate and nose are normal. Which of the following statements describes the cause of the abnormality?", "answer": "Failure of fusion of the left maxillary prominence and the medial nasal process of the frontonasal prominence", "options": {"A": "Failure of development of the first pharyngeal arch", "B": "Failure of fusion of the left maxillary prominence and the medial nasal process of the frontonasal prominence", "C": "Partial resorption of the first pharyngeal arch", "D": "Failure of development of the left maxillary prominence"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nThe question describes a newborn with a cleft lip, which is typically associated with abnormalities in the formation of facial structures during embryonic development.\n\nFirstly, let's consider the options provided:\n\nA. Failure of development of the first pharyngeal arch - The first pharyngeal arch (mandibular arch) contributes to the formation of several structures, including the jaw and the muscles of mastication. However, it is not directly associated with the formation of facial features such as a cleft lip.\n\nB. Failure of fusion of the left maxillary prominence and the medial nasal process of the frontonasal prominence - The maxillary prominences are crucial for the development of the upper jaw and palate. The medial nasal process contributes to the formation of the nose. A failure in their fusion is indeed associated with cleft lip and palate, as seen in this case.\n\nC. Partial resorption of the first pharyngeal arch - This option does not accurately describe a known embryological process related to facial development.\n\nD. Failure of development of the left maxillary prominence - While it's true that the left side is affected, the specific issue here appears to be with the fusion of structures rather than their developmental failure.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate explanation for the abnormality described in the question is the failure of fusion of the left maxillary prominence and the medial nasal process of the frontonasal prominence. This would lead to a cleft lip on the left side as seen in this case.", "pred_ans": "B", "embedding": [-0.023355482, 0.024050992, -0.034512274, 0.0050763986, -0.07759114, 0.022535797, -0.025795858,

{"idx": 468, "question": "A 5-year-old girl swallows a marble while playing and is rushed to the hospital by her mother. The patient\u2019s mother says she suddenly started to cough violently and made \"funny breathing\" sounds for a few minutes which then resolved. Her pulse is 100/min and respirations are 28/min. Physical examination reveals a girl in no obvious distress and breathing comfortably. There are diminished breath sounds and mild expiratory wheezing over the lower right lung field. A chest X-ray is performed which shows a round foreign body about 1 cm \u00d71 cm in the lower portion of the right inferior lobe. Which of the following changes in blood flow through the affected part of the lung would most likely be present in this patient?", "answer": "Blood flow would be decreased due to arterial vasoconstriction.", "options": {"A": "Blood flow would be increased due to arterial vasodilation.", "B": "Blood flow would be unchanged due to autoregulation.", "C": "Blood flow would be unchanged due to decreased surfactant.", "D": "Blood flow would be decreased due to arterial vasoconstriction."}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nFirst, let's analyze the situation: a 5-year-old girl swallows a marble while playing and is rushed to the hospital with symptoms of coughing violently and \"funny breathing\" sounds that resolved. The physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds and mild expiratory wheezing over the lower right lung field.\n\nGiven these findings, it's likely that the foreign body has caused an obstruction in the airway, leading to increased resistance and decreased airflow through the affected part of the lung. This would result in a decrease in blood flow to that area due to the increased vascular resistance.\n\nThe chest X-ray confirms this suspicion, showing a round foreign body in the lower portion of the right inferior lobe.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA. Blood flow would be increased due to arterial vasodilation.\n- This is unlikely because the symptoms and physical examination findings suggest an obstruction rather than vasodilation.\n\nB. Blood flow would be unchanged due to autoregulation.\n- Autoregulation is a mechanism that maintains blood flow at a constant level despite changes in systemic or local metabolic rates. However, this doesn't apply directly to the situation described, where there's an apparent increase in vascular resistance due to obstruction.\n\nC. Blood flow would be unchanged due to decreased surfactant.\n- Surfactant reduces surface tension in the alveoli, making it easier to breathe. Decreased surfactant would actually worsen respiratory distress and wouldn't explain the observed symptoms.\n\nD. Blood flow would be decreased due to arterial vasoconstriction.\n- This is the most likely explanation. When an airway obstruction occurs, the body tries to compensate by constricting blood vessels near the site of the obstruction (in this case, the right inferior lobe). This constriction reduces blood flow to that area, which can help alleviate symptoms like coughing and wheezing.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [0.04004091, 0.058499172, 0.030801348, 0.01871134,

{"idx": 471, "question": "A 33-year-old woman comes to the emergency department for the evaluation of a headache and increased sweating for the last two hours. The patient also reports palpitations and nausea. Yesterday, she was started on venlafaxine for treatment-resistant depression. She took citalopram for four weeks, but stopped three days ago because her symptoms of depression did not improve. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. On mental status examination, the patient is only oriented to person, but not to place or time. Examination shows tremors in all extremities. She has impaired gait. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?", "answer": "Increased CNS serotonergic activity", "options": {"A": "Abnormal ryanodine receptor", "B": "Increased CNS serotonergic activity", "C": "Dopamine receptor blockade", "D": "Anticholinergic toxicity"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation, including headache, increased sweating, palpitations, nausea, fever (39\u00b0C), tachycardia (120/min), hypertension (150/90 mm Hg), tremors, impaired gait, and deep tendon reflexes 3+ bilaterally, we can deduce that her symptoms are likely related to a medication side effect.\n\nFirstly, the patient's recent history of starting venlafaxine for treatment-resistant depression is crucial. Venlafaxine is an SNRI (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor), and it can cause various side effects, including serotonin syndrome, which presents with symptoms such as increased sweating, tremors, agitation, and autonomic dysfunction.\n\nThe patient's current symptoms of headache, palpitations, nausea, fever, tachycardia, hypertension, tremors, impaired gait, and deep tendon reflexes 3+ bilaterally are all consistent with serotonin syndrome. The fact that she was started on citalopram (an SSRI) three days ago but stopped due to lack of improvement in her symptoms further supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is therefore increased CNS serotonergic activity, which can be caused by an SNRI like venlafaxine. This condition requires prompt recognition and treatment to prevent serious complications such as serotonin syndrome.\n\nIn contrast, the other options are less likely:\n\n- Abnormal ryanodine receptor (A) is associated with malignant hyperthermia, a rare but life-threatening medical emergency that can occur during general anesthesia.\n- Dopamine receptor blockade (C) could be related to antipsychotic medications or certain antidepressants like risperidone, but it's not the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.\n- Anticholinergic toxicity (D) is more commonly associated with medications like scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which are used for treating motion sickness, allergies, and urinary retention.

{"idx": 480, "question": "A 71-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter after she found him to be extremely confused at home. She says that he appeared to be fine in the morning; however, upon returning home, she found that he was slumped in his chair and was hard to arouse. She was worried that he may have taken too many medications and rushed him to the emergency department. His past medical history is significant for bipolar disorder and absence seizures. He does not smoke and drinks 4 alcoholic beverages per night on average. On physical exam, he is found to have a flapping tremor of his hands, pitting ankle edema, and gynecomastia. He does not appear to have any focal neurologic deficits. Which of the following lab findings would most likely be seen in this patient?", "answer": "Increased prothrombin time", "options": {"A": "Increased antidepressant levels", "B": "Increased bleeding time", "C": "Increased d-dimer levels", "D": "Increased prothrombin time"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation, including confusion, slumped posture, flapping tremor of his hands, pitting ankle edema, and gynecomastia, along with a history of bipolar disorder and absence seizures, we can deduce that this patient is likely experiencing a manic episode. The presence of a flapping tremor, particularly in the context of a manic episode, is highly suggestive of lithium toxicity.\n\nLithium toxicity can cause a range of symptoms, including tremors, confusion, and altered mental status. However, the physical examination findings such as pitting ankle edema and gynecomastia are also consistent with lithium toxicity.\n\nThe lab finding that would most likely be seen in this patient is increased prothrombin time (PT), which is a marker of liver function and coagulation pathway. Lithium toxicity can cause an increase in PT, leading to prolonged bleeding times.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [-0.01159233, 0.03155468, 0.027137134, 0.07550497, -0.076792285, 0.003902642,

{"idx": 497, "question": "A 28-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by a friend after fainting at work and hitting her head. She is conscious, alert, and in pain as she sustained a deep laceration above her right orbit. When asked about prior fainting episodes, she says that she has had them since childhood, but she felt it was \"nothing serious\". She also says she has frequent palpitations, shortness of breath, nausea, and, at times, chest pain and attributes this to \"working too hard.\" Her pulse is 110/min, respirations are 20/min, temperature is 37.4\u00b0C (99.3\u00b0F), and blood pressure is 110/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows tachycardia and mild hypotension. The patient's electrocardiogram is obtained. Which of the following drugs is the preferable choice for first line treatment of the patient's condition?", "answer": "Magnesium sulfate", "options": {"A": "Calcium gluconate", "B": "Flecainide", "C": "Magnesium sulfate", "D": "Procainamide"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's history of recurrent fainting episodes, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, and current presentation with tachycardia, mild hypotension, and signs of cardiac ischemia (tachycardia and mild hypotension), we need to consider medications that can help stabilize cardiac rhythm and improve blood pressure.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Calcium gluconate - This is a calcium channel blocker that can help reduce the risk of arrhythmias but does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\nB. Flecainide - This is an anti-arrhythmic medication that can be used to treat certain types of arrhythmias, but it may not be the best choice for this patient given her history of recurrent fainting episodes and current presentation with signs of cardiac ischemia.\n\nC. Magnesium sulfate - This is a vasodilator that can help reduce blood pressure and improve cardiac output in cases of hypotension. It also has anti-arrhythmic properties, which may be beneficial for patients with arrhythmias. Given the patient's symptoms, magnesium sulfate could potentially address both her hypotension and potential cardiac ischemia.\n\nD. Procainamide - This is an anti-arrhythmic medication that can be used to treat certain types of arrhythmias but may not be the best choice for this patient given her history of recurrent fainting episodes and current presentation with signs of cardiac ischemia.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms, including tachycardia, mild hypotension, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, and signs of cardiac ischemia, magnesium sulfate appears to be the most appropriate choice for first-line treatment.

{"idx": 504, "question": "An investigator is studying brachial artery reactivity in women with suspected coronary heart disease. The brachial artery diameter is measured via ultrasound before and after intra-arterial injection of acetylcholine. An increase of 7% in the vascular diameter is noted. The release of which of the following is most likely responsible for the observed effect?", "answer": "Nitric oxide from endothelial cells", "options": {"A": "Nitric oxide from endothelial cells", "B": "Endothelin from the peripheral vasculature", "C": "Serotonin from neuroendocrine cells", "D": "Norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo approach this question, let's break down the key elements and think through them step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the context**: The investigator is studying brachial artery reactivity in women with suspected coronary heart disease. This implies that we are looking at how blood vessels respond to a specific stimulus (acetylcholine) before and after a potential underlying condition.\n\n2. **The role of acetylcholine**: Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that can cause the smooth muscle surrounding blood vessels to relax, leading to an increase in vascular diameter. This effect is often used as a diagnostic tool for coronary artery disease because it can help identify whether or not there is significant vasodilation (widening) of the arteries.\n\n3. **The observed effect**: An increase of 7% in the vascular diameter after acetylcholine injection suggests that the response to acetylcholine was positive, indicating normal or near-normal vasodilation.\n\n4. **Considering the options**:\n   - A. Nitric oxide from endothelial cells: Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator produced by the endothelium (the inner lining of blood vessels). It plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular tone and function. An increase in nitric oxide production would likely lead to an increase in vascular diameter, consistent with the observed effect.\n   - B. Endothelin from the peripheral vasculature: Endothelin is a vasoconstrictor produced by the endothelium. It can cause blood vessels to constrict or narrow, which would decrease vascular diameter rather than increase it.\n   - C. Serotonin from neuroendocrine cells: Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that can also cause vasoconstriction in some cases. However, its effect on vascular diameter is generally more variable and less consistent compared to nitric oxide.\n   - D. Norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla: Norepinephrine is a catecholamine that can cause vasoconstriction. While it could potentially increase vascular diameter in some contexts, its effect would likely be more pronounced than an 7% increase.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the understanding of acetylcholine's role as a vasodilator and the expected response to normal or near-normal vasodilation, the most likely cause of the observed effect is nitric oxide from endothelial cells.",

{"idx": 587, "question": "A 57-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for worsening pain and swelling of his left ankle for the past 2 hours. The pain is severe and awakened him from sleep. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and pravastatin. His temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100.1\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, and blood pressure is 148/96 mm Hg. Examination shows exquisite tenderness, erythema, and edema of the left ankle; active and passive range of motion is limited by pain. Arthrocentesis of the ankle joint yields cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 19,500/mm3 (80% segmented neutrophils). Gram stain is negative. A photomicrograph of the joint fluid aspirate under polarized light is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?", "answer": "Colchicine", "options": {"A": "Probenecid", "B": "Colchicine and allopurinol", "C": "Triamcinolone and probenecid", "D": "Colchicine"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\n### Initial Assessment:\nThe patient presents with severe pain, swelling, and erythema of the left ankle, which worsened over 2 hours, accompanied by hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The presence of cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 19,500/mm^3 (80% segmented neutrophils) on arthrocentesis is indicative of an inflammatory process.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis:\nGiven the clinical presentation, several differential diagnoses can be considered:\n\n1. Gout: Characterized by sudden onset of severe pain, redness, and swelling in one or more joints, often accompanied by elevated uric acid levels.\n2. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): Involves chronic inflammation of the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and swelling.\n3. Septic Arthritis: An infection within a joint that can cause severe pain, redness, and swelling.\n\n### Pharmacotherapy Options:\nThe options provided for pharmacotherapy are:\n\nA. Probenecid\nB. Colchicine and allopurinol\nC. Triamcinolone and probenecid\nD. Colchicine\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Gout Consideration**: The presence of cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 19,500/mm^3 (80% segmented neutrophils) is highly suggestive of gout. Gout is characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and pain.\n2. **Rheumatoid Arthritis Consideration**: While RA can cause joint pain and swelling, it typically presents with chronic symptoms over weeks or months, rather than an acute presentation like this.\n3. **Septic Arthritis Consideration**: This condition is less likely given the lack of fever (37.8\u00b0C) and other systemic signs of infection.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the clinical presentation suggestive of gout, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be Colchicine, which is effective in treating acute gout attacks. Probenecid may also be considered for long-term management of gout but is not the first-line treatment for an acute attack. The other options are less likely to be correct based on the provided information.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [-0.012373384, -0.040285386, -0.012185719, 0.09136961, -0.020424375, 0.015714087,

{"idx": 613, "question": "A 72-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of pain and bulging in his groin. He is otherwise healthy and has never had surgery. He is referred to a general surgeon, and is scheduled for an elective hernia repair the following week. On closer inspection in the operating room, the surgeon notes a hernia sac that protrudes through the external inguinal ring, bypassing the inguinal canal. Which of the following accurately describes this patient's condition?", "answer": "Direct inguinal hernia", "options": {"A": "Indirect femoral hernia", "B": "Direct incisional hernia", "C": "Isolated rectus diastasis", "D": "Direct inguinal hernia"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nThe key to answering this question lies in understanding the anatomy and the pathophysiology of each type of hernia.\n\nFirstly, let's define what each option represents:\n\nA. Indirect femoral hernia: This occurs when tissue pushes through a weak spot in the abdominal muscles (the fascial layer) near the groin, but not directly through the external inguinal ring. It is more common in women due to their higher fat content and wider pelvis.\n\nB. Direct incisional hernia: This type of hernia occurs when tissue pushes through a weakened area in the abdominal wall that was previously created by an incision (cut) during surgery. In this case, the patient had elective hernia repair for his inguinal hernia.\n\nC. Isolated rectus diastasis: This refers to a condition where there is a separation of the two layers of the rectus abdominis muscle without any protrusion through the external inguinal ring. It can be caused by various factors, including trauma or surgery, but it does not involve tissue pushing through the weak spot in the abdominal wall.\n\nD. Direct inguinal hernia: This is a type of hernia that occurs when tissue pushes through a weakened area in the abdominal wall near the groin, directly through the external inguinal ring.\n\nGiven the information provided and the description of the patient's condition, where there is a hernia sac protruding through the external inguinal ring bypassing the inguinal canal, the most accurate description is:\n\nThe patient has a direct inguinal hernia. This type of hernia occurs when tissue pushes through a weakened area in the abdominal wall near the groin, directly through the external inguinal ring.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [0.043258447,

{"idx": 640, "question": "A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 5-month history of a pruritic rash on the bilateral upper extremities. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. A skin biopsy of the rash shows intraepidermal accumulation of edematous fluid and widening of intercellular spaces between keratinocytes. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "answer": "Eczematous dermatitis", "options": {"A": "Psoriasis vulgaris", "B": "Lichen planus", "C": "Acanthosis nigricans", "D": "Eczematous dermatitis"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation with a pruritic rash on the bilateral upper extremities for 5 months, we should consider conditions that can cause skin inflammation and edema.\n\nFirstly, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Psoriasis vulgaris: This is an autoimmune condition characterized by thickening of the skin due to excessive keratinization. While it can present with pruritic plaques, the biopsy findings described (intraepidermal accumulation of edematous fluid and widening of intercellular spaces between keratinocytes) are more suggestive of a different condition.\n\nB. Lichen planus: This is an inflammatory condition that affects mucous membranes and skin, characterized by purplish, itchy, flat bumps. The biopsy findings described do not match lichen planus, which typically shows subepidermal inflammation with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration.\n\nC. Acanthosis nigricans: This is a benign condition characterized by dark, velvety skin patches, often in the neck, armpits, or groin area. It can be associated with insulin resistance and obesity but does not typically present with the described biopsy findings.\n\nD. Eczematous dermatitis (atopic dermatitis): This is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that causes itchy, dry, and scaly patches on the skin. The biopsy findings of intraepidermal accumulation of edematous fluid and widening of intercellular spaces between keratinocytes are highly suggestive of eczematous dermatitis.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most likely diagnosis is eczematous dermatitis, which is a common condition that can cause pruritic rashes on the skin. The biopsy findings support this diagnosis by showing intraepidermal edema and widening of intercellular spaces between keratinocytes, consistent with the pathophysiology of eczematous dermatitis.",

Normal serum osmolality ranges from approximately 285-295 mOsm/kg. A serum osmolality of 1085 mOsm/L is significantly higher than normal, indicating that the plasma is hypertonic.\n\nGiven this context, we need to consider what could cause a hyperosmotic state in the body. The primary mechanism for producing a hyperosmotic state is through the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, from the posterior pituitary gland into the bloodstream.\n\nThe cell bodies responsible for secreting ADH are located in the hypothalamus. Specifically, the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in the hypothalamus contain neurons that produce ADH. When these neurons receive signals to release ADH, it is transported through axons to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored in vesicles called neurosecretory granules.\n\nTherefore, considering the information provided:\n\n- The cell bodies of the cells behaving abnormally are located in the hypothalamus.\n- They produce and secrete ADH, leading to a hyperosmotic state in the body.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\nA. Acidophils are not directly related to the regulation of sodium levels or osmolality in this context.\nB. Chromophobes are actually a type of melanocyte involved in producing melanin and are not relevant to this scenario.\nD.

{"idx": 672, "question": "A 57-year-old male presents with a primary complaint of erectile dysfunction. After proper evaluation, the patient is started on daily administration of sildenafil. This medication directly causes accumulation of which of the following intracellular mediators?", "answer": "cGMP", "options": {"A": "Ca2+", "B": "cGMP", "C": "AMP", "D": "ANP"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo answer this question, let's break down the key concepts and relationships involved.\n\n1. **Understanding the context**: The patient is started on daily administration of sildenafil for erectile dysfunction (ED). Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, which is commonly used to treat ED by increasing blood flow to the penis.\n\n2. **Mechanism of action of sildenafil**: Sildenafil works by inhibiting the enzyme PDE5, which breaks down cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP is a key intracellular mediator involved in smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.\n\n3. **Relationship between sildenafil and cGMP**: Since sildenafil inhibits PDE5, it increases the levels of cGMP within the target tissues, including the corpus cavernosum of the penis. This increase in cGMP leads to smooth muscle relaxation, increased blood flow, and ultimately, an erection.\n\n4. **Eliminating incorrect options**:\n   - A. Ca2+ (Calcium ions) are involved in various cellular processes, but they are not directly accumulated as a result of sildenafil's action.\n   - C. AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) is another intracellular molecule that can be affected by various drugs, but it is not the primary mediator accumulated due to sildenafil's action.\n   - D. ANP (Atrial natriuretic peptide) is involved in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance, but it is not directly related to sildenafil's mechanism of action.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the understanding of sildenafil's mechanism of action and its effects on intracellular mediators, the correct answer is B. cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate).", "pred_ans": "B", "embedding":

{"idx": 741, "question": "A 29-year-old man presents to the primary care clinic in June for post-discharge follow-up. The patient was recently admitted to the hospital after a motor vehicle collision. At that time he arrived at the emergency department unconscious, hypotensive, and tachycardic. Abdominal CT revealed a hemoperitoneum due to a large splenic laceration; he was taken to the operating room for emergency splenectomy. Since that time he has recovered well without complications. Prior to the accident, he was up-to-date on all of his vaccinations. Which of the following vaccinations should be administered at this time?", "answer": "13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine", "options": {"A": "13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine", "B": "Inactivated (intramuscular) influenza vaccine", "C": "Measles-mumps-rubella vaccine", "D": "Tetanus booster vaccine"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's recent history of a motor vehicle collision, which increases his risk for certain infections such as meningitis and sepsis, it is crucial to assess whether he has been adequately vaccinated against these pathogens.\n\nThe patient was up-to-date on all of his vaccinations prior to the accident. However, since he recently had a significant trauma (motor vehicle collision), we need to consider whether any of the vaccines listed would be contraindicated or not recommended at this time.\n\nA. 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine - This vaccine is typically administered annually and provides protection against 13 serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which can cause severe infections such as meningitis and sepsis. Given the patient's recent trauma, administering this vaccine could potentially increase his risk for complications from these infections.\n\nB. Inactivated (intramuscular) influenza vaccine - The inactivated flu vaccine is typically recommended every year during the flu season or upon exposure to someone with a flu-like illness. Since there was no mention of the patient being exposed to someone with a flu-like illness, administering this vaccine at this time would not be necessary.\n\nC. Measles-mumps-rubella vaccine - This vaccine is usually administered in two doses, 12-15 months apart, and protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. Given that the patient was up-to-date on all vaccinations prior to the accident, administering this vaccine at this time would not be necessary.\n\nD. Tetanus booster vaccine - The tetanus toxoid is typically administered every 10 years or as needed based on exposure history. Since there was no mention of any recent exposure to tetanus or a wound that required surgical intervention, administering a tetanus booster vaccine at this time would not be necessary.\n\nConsidering the patient's recent trauma and potential increased risk for certain infections, the most appropriate vaccination at this time is the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. This vaccine provides protection against serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae that are commonly associated with severe infections such as meningitis and sepsis.", "pred_ans": "A", "embedding":

She reports that a long time ago her gynecologist told her that she had \u201csome cysts in her ovaries but not to worry about it.\u201d The pain started last night and has progressively gotten worse. Nothing seems to make it better or worse. She denies headache, dizziness, chest pain, dyspnea, diarrhea, or constipation; she endorses nausea, dysuria for the past 3 days, and chills. Her temperature is 100.7\u00b0F (38.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 132/94 mmHg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 14/min. Physical examination is significant for right lower quadrant and flank pain with voluntary guarding. What is the most likely pathophysiology of this patient\u2019s condition?", "answer": "Ascending infection of the urinary tract", "options": {"A": "Ascending infection of the urinary tract", "B": "Cessation of venous drainage from the ovaries", "C": "Inflammation of the appendix", "D": "Vesicoureteral reflex"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and history, we can deduce that she is experiencing a condition related to her past medical history involving cysts in her ovaries.\n\n1. **Past medical history of diabetes**: This is crucial because it increases the risk for certain conditions, such as diabetic nephropathy or retinopathy, which could be relevant to this patient's current presentation.\n2. **Cysts in the ovaries**: The fact that she had \"some cysts\" in her ovaries a long time ago suggests that these may have been benign (non-cancerous) and possibly related to her diabetes.\n3. **Pain started last night and has progressively worsened**: This indicates an acute onset of pain, which could be due to several causes but is more likely related to the cysts or their rupture.\n4. **Denies headache, dizziness, chest pain, dyspnea, diarrhea, or constipation; endorses nausea, dysuria for the past 3 days, and chills**: These symptoms suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI), which could be related to her past medical history of cysts in the ovaries.\n5. **Physical examination significant for right lower quadrant and flank pain with voluntary guarding**: This finding is highly suggestive of a renal or ureteral issue, such as pyelonephritis or a kidney stone.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely pathophysiology of this patient's condition is an **ascending infection of the urinary tract**, specifically a pyelonephritis. The vesicoureteral reflex (D) could be involved in the development of UTIs, but it is not the primary cause of her symptoms. Inflammation of the appendix (C) and cessation of venous drainage from the ovaries (B) are less likely given the patient's history and current presentation.", "pred_ans": "A", "embedding":

{"idx": 807, "question": "A 43-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 2, comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding. Pelvic examination shows blood and clots in the posterior fornix and normal-appearing internal and external genitalia. An endometrial biopsy specimen shows straight uniform tubular glands lined with tall pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells with high mitotic activity embedded in an edematous stroma. Increased activity of which of the following is directly responsible for the histologic appearance of the biopsy specimen?", "answer": "Aromatase", "options": {"A": "Luteinizing hormone", "B": "Corpus luteum", "C": "5-alpha-reductase", "D": "Aromatase"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding.\n2. Pelvic examination reveals blood and clots in the posterior fornix, which suggests that there may be an endometrial hyperplasia or atrophy.\n3. An endometrial biopsy specimen shows straight uniform tubular glands lined with tall pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells with high mitotic activity embedded in an edematous stroma.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the patient likely has endometrial hyperplasia due to hormonal imbalance.\n\nThe histologic appearance of the biopsy specimen is characterized by:\n\n* Straight uniform tubular glands lined with tall pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells\n* High mitotic activity embedded in an edematous stroma\n\nThese features are typical of endometrial hyperplasia, which is often caused by estrogen excess.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA. Luteinizing hormone (LH) - LH stimulates the growth of the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. While LH can stimulate the growth of endometrial glands, it is not directly responsible for the histologic appearance described in this case.\n\nB. Corpus luteum - As mentioned earlier, the corpus luteum is stimulated by LH to produce progesterone, but it does not cause the histologic appearance described in this case.\n\nC. 5-alpha-reductase - This enzyme is involved in the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which plays a role in the development of prostate tissue. It is not directly related to endometrial hyperplasia.\n\nD. Aromatase - This enzyme is responsible for converting androgens into estrogens, which are then converted into estriol by the placenta during pregnancy. In non-pregnant women, aromatase activity is low, but in pregnant women, it increases significantly to support fetal development. The increased estrogen production leads to an increase in endometrial thickness and proliferation, resulting in endometrial hyperplasia.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [0.051521968, 0.018442845,

{"idx": 823, "question": "A 75-year-old man is brought to the emergency room after being found unconscious in his home. His medical history is unknown. On physical examination he does not demonstrate any spontaneous movement of his extremities and is unable to respond to voice or painful stimuli. You notice that he is able blink and move his eyes in the vertical plane. Based on these physical exam findings, you expect that magnetic resonance angiogram will most likely reveal an occlusion in which of the following vessels?", "answer": "Basilar artery", "options": {"A": "Anterior cerebral artery", "B": "Anterior inferior cerebellar artery", "C": "Basilar artery", "D": "Posterior cerebral artery"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation of complete spinal rigidity (not demonstrating any spontaneous movement of his extremities) and inability to respond to voice or painful stimuli, it is highly suggestive of a spinal cord injury or compression. The fact that he can blink and move his eyes in the vertical plane suggests that there is no significant damage to the brainstem or cranial nerves.\n\nThe magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) is a sensitive test for detecting vascular abnormalities in the spine, particularly those affecting the spinal cord. Based on the patient's symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is an occlusion of a vessel supplying blood to the spinal cord.\n\nConsidering the options provided:\n\nA. Anterior cerebral artery - This artery primarily supplies blood to the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain, which are not directly involved in this case.\n\nB. Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) - While AICA can be affected by vascular malformations or tumors, it is less likely to cause spinal cord compression compared to other options.\n\nC. Basilar artery - The basilar artery is a critical vessel that supplies blood to the brainstem, cerebellum, and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries (PICA). An occlusion of the basilar artery can compress the spinal cord, leading to symptoms such as loss of consciousness, inability to respond to stimuli, and vertical eye movement.\n\nD. Posterior cerebral artery - This artery primarily supplies blood to the occipital lobe and parts of the temporal lobe, which are not directly involved in this case.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and the anatomy of the spinal cord, the most likely vessel affected by an occlusion is the basilar artery, as it provides critical blood supply to the brainstem and cerebellum, areas that can be compressed by a spinal cord lesion.", "pred_ans": "C", "embedding": [0.029646717, -0.00083796424, 0.0005593634, 0.02674135, -0.07074904, -0.05138423, -0.0015096026, 0.052341443, -0.036040623,

{"idx": 833, "question": "A neonate born at 33 weeks is transferred to the NICU after a complicated pregnancy and C-section. A week after being admitted, he developed a fever and become lethargic and minimally responsive to stimuli. A lumbar puncture is performed that reveals the following:\nAppearance  Cloudy\nProtein 64 mg/dL\nGlucose 22 mg/dL\nPressure 330 mm H20\nCells 295 cells/mm\u00b3 (> 90% PMN)\nA specimen is sent to microbiology and reveals gram-negative rods. Which of the following is the next appropriate step in management?", "answer": "Start the patient on IV cefotaxime", "options": {"A": "Provide supportive measures only", "B": "MRI scan of the head", "C": "Start the patient on IV cefotaxime", "D": "Start the patient on oral rifampin"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\n### Initial Assessment:\nThe neonate is presenting with signs of meningitis, including fever, lethargy, and minimal responsiveness to stimuli. The lumbar puncture reveals a cloudy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with elevated protein levels, decreased glucose, increased pressure, and a high cell count (>90% polymorphonuclear neutrophils or PMN). The presence of gram-negative rods in the CSF is particularly concerning for bacterial meningitis.\n\n### Next Steps:\nGiven the clinical presentation and microbiological findings, the next appropriate step in management should be to initiate antibiotic therapy. However, before starting antibiotics, it's essential to consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Bacterial Identification**: While the presence of gram-negative rods suggests a possible bacterial cause, the exact type of bacteria (e.g., Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae) cannot be determined from the CSF alone.\n2. **Risk of Over-Treatment**: Starting antibiotics without identifying the causative organism may lead to unnecessary treatment and potential harm due to antibiotic resistance or side effects.\n\n### Management Options:\nConsidering these factors:\n\nA. **Provide supportive measures only**: This option is not appropriate as it does not address the underlying cause of meningitis.\nB. **MRI scan of the head**: While an MRI might be useful for evaluating the extent of brain involvement, it is not the immediate next step in managing suspected bacterial meningitis.\nC. **Start the patient on IV cefotaxime**: This option addresses the need to identify and treat the likely causative organism (gram-negative rods) but does not consider the potential benefits of early antibiotic therapy in reducing morbidity and mortality.\nD. **Start the patient on oral rifampin**: Rifampin is a potent bactericidal agent that can be effective against certain bacterial meningitis pathogens, including Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, it should be used judiciously due to potential side effects (e.g., hepatotoxicity) and the need for close monitoring.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the clinical presentation and microbiological findings, the most appropriate next step in management is to start the patient on IV cefotaxime, which addresses the likely causative organism while considering the potential benefits of early antibiotic therapy. This approach balances the risk of over-treatment with the need for effective treatment.", "pred_ans": "C", "embedding": [0.024727471, -0.001907724, -0.010446821, 0.03257333, -0.027361084,

Salmonella: While Salmonella can cause diarrhea and dehydration, it is more commonly associated with bloody stools and is less likely in this case.\n\nB. Shigella: Similar to Salmonella, Shigella typically causes bloody diarrhea and is not as strongly linked to non-bloody stools or severe dehydration.\n\nC. Rotavirus: This virus is a leading cause of severe gastroenteritis in children worldwide, particularly those under the age of 5. It can cause significant fluid loss and dehydration, making it a strong candidate for this patient's symptoms.\n\nD. Norovirus: While Norovirus is also a common cause of gastroenteritis, it typically causes non-bloody diarrhea and is more commonly associated with outbreaks in daycare centers or other settings where close contact occurs.\n\nGiven the information provided, Rotavirus (C) is the most likely responsible organism for this child's symptoms.

{"idx": 883, "question": "A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency room with an acute myocardial infarction. Twenty-four hours after admission to the cardiac intensive care unit, he develops oliguria. Laboratory tests show that his serum BUN is 59 mg/dL and his serum creatinine is 6.2 mg/dL. Renal biopsy reveals necrosis of the proximal tubules and thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. Which of the following would you most likely observe on a microscopic examination of this patient's urine?", "answer": "Muddy brown casts", "options": {"A": "Fatty casts", "B": "Muddy brown casts", "C": "Hyaline casts", "D": "Broad waxy casts"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nFirst, let's consider the clinical presentation and laboratory findings:\n\n1. The patient has an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 24 hours ago, which suggests that his renal function may be compromised due to the ischemia.\n2. Twenty-four hours after admission to the cardiac intensive care unit, he develops oliguria, indicating a decrease in urine output.\n3. Laboratory tests show elevated serum BUN and creatinine levels, indicating impaired renal function.\n\nGiven these findings, we can consider the possible causes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in this patient:\n\n1. **Ischemic AKI**: The patient's recent myocardial infarction could be contributing to his AKI.\n2. **Rhabdomyolysis**: Although not explicitly mentioned, rhabdomyolysis is a known complication of AMI that can lead to renal failure.\n\nNow, let's consider the microscopic findings on the renal biopsy:\n\n1. Necrosis of the proximal tubules and thick ascending limb of Henle's loop suggests that the kidney is under stress due to ischemia or other insults.\n2. The presence of necrotic cells in these areas indicates cell death, which can lead to the release of cellular contents into the urine.\n\nConsidering these points, we can evaluate the options:\n\nA. Fatty casts: These are typically seen in conditions with high proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia, such as nephrotic syndrome or diabetic nephropathy.\nB. Muddy brown casts: These are often associated with ischemia or infarction of the renal tubules, which is consistent with this patient's presentation.\nC. Hyaline casts: While these can be seen in various conditions, they are not specific to ischemic AKI or rhabdomyolysis.\nD. Broad waxy casts: These are typically associated with nephrotic syndrome.\n\nBased on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely microscopic finding is muddy brown casts, which are indicative of ischemia or infarction in the renal tubules.", "pred_ans": "B", "embedding": [0.01846983, 0.008895178, -0.02060523, 0.027429566, 0.05468988, -0.09511595, 0.06663039, 0.066265725,

{"idx": 890, "question": "A 50-year-old man undergoes parathyroidectomy for treatment-resistant hyperparathyroidism. The procedure is complicated by brisk bleeding from an artery that travels along the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. To stop the bleeding, the artery is ligated at its origin. Which of the following is most likely the origin of the artery that was injured in this patient?", "answer": "External carotid artery", "options": {"A": "Subclavian artery", "B": "Internal carotid artery", "C": "External carotid artery", "D": "Thyrocervical trunk"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo determine the origin of the artery that was injured during parathyroidectomy, we need to consider the anatomical relationships between the structures involved.\n\nFirstly, let's identify the key structures in this scenario:\n\n1. The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is a branch of the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X).\n2. The artery that travels along this nerve is likely to be a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, which is a major artery that arises from the subclavian artery.\n\nThe thyrocervical trunk typically branches into three main arteries:\n\n1. The superior thyroid artery\n2. The inferior thyroid artery\n3. The external carotid artery (specifically, its terminal branch, the lingual artery)\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that the artery that was injured during parathyroidectomy is most likely to be the external carotid artery.", "pred_ans": "C", "embedding": [0.012087799, 0.013504391, 0.044227254, -0.020473985, -0.079173066, -0.047346078, -0.067179725, 0.11927002, -0.0030621307,

Which of the following best accounts for these findings?", "answer": "Splice site mutation", "options": {"A": "Frameshift mutation", "B": "Missense mutation", "C": "Nonsense mutation", "D": "Splice site mutation"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo approach this question, let's consider what we know about beta thalassemia and the types of mutations that can affect protein function.\n\nBeta thalassemia is a genetic disorder characterized by reduced or absent production of the beta-globin chains of hemoglobin. This results in anemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis (red blood cell production). The malformed protein found in the boy's red blood cells suggests that there has been a mutation affecting the structure or function of the beta-globin chain.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Frameshift mutation: A frameshift mutation occurs when an insertion or deletion of nucleotides changes the reading frame of the genetic code, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence. This type of mutation is unlikely to result in a protein with 160 amino acids, as it would likely introduce stop codons or premature termination signals.\n\nB. Missense mutation: A missense mutation involves a change in one amino acid residue in a protein due to a point mutation in the DNA sequence. While this can lead to changes in protein function, it typically results in a single amino acid substitution rather than a significant increase in size (160 amino acids).\n\nC. Nonsense mutation: A nonsense mutation is a type of point mutation that introduces a premature stop codon into the genetic code, leading to a truncated and often non-functional protein. This would result in a shorter protein with fewer amino acids.\n\nD. Splice site mutation: A splice site mutation involves a change at one of the introns (non-coding regions) or exons (coding regions) that affects the splicing process, leading to aberrant mRNA processing and potentially resulting in an abnormal protein. This type of mutation can lead to significant changes in protein size.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most likely explanation for the malformed protein with a length of 160 amino acids is a splice site mutation. This would disrupt normal mRNA splicing, leading to aberrant protein production that results in the observed 160-amino acid protein.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [-0.02312925, -0.007749305,

{"idx": 958, "question": "A 4-month-old boy is brought to his pediatrician for a well-child visit. His parents have noticed that he has had poor growth compared to his older siblings. The boy was delivered vaginally after a normal pregnancy. His temperature is 98.8\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 98/68 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 20/min. On exam, his abdomen appears protuberant, and the boy appears to have abnormally enlarged cheeks. A finger stick reveals that the patient\u2019s fasting blood glucose is 50 mg/dL. On further laboratory testing, the patient is found to have elevated blood lactate levels, as well as no response to a glucagon stimulation test. What enzymatic defect is most likely present?", "answer": "Glucose-6-phosphatase", "options": {"A": "Alpha-1,4-glucosidase", "B": "Alpha-1,6-glucosidase", "C": "Glucose-6-phosphatase", "D": "Glycogen synthase"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the clinical presentation of this 4-month-old boy, we can deduce that he has a form of congenital hypoglycemia of the infant type (CHI). This condition is characterized by impaired glucose production in the liver due to an enzymatic defect.\n\nThe key features of CHI include:\n\n1. Poor growth and failure to thrive\n2. Abnormally enlarged cheeks, also known as macroglossia\n3. Elevated blood lactate levels\n4. No response to glucagon stimulation test\n\nElevated blood lactate levels are a hallmark of this condition, indicating that the liver is not producing enough glucose.\n\nThe most likely enzymatic defect in CHI is related to the regulation of glucose production in the liver. Let's consider the options:\n\nA. Alpha-1,4-glucosidase: This enzyme is involved in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Deficiency in this enzyme leads to Pompe disease, a type of glycogen storage disorder.\n\nB. Alpha-1,6-glucosidase: This enzyme is also involved in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Deficiency in this enzyme leads to Andersen disease, another type of glycogen storage disorder.\n\nC. Glucose-6-phosphatase: This enzyme is crucial for the final step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, converting glucose-6-phosphate into glucose. Deficiency in this enzyme leads to von Gierke's disease, a form of glycogen storage disorder.\n\nD. Glycogen synthase: This enzyme is involved in glycogen synthesis. While its deficiency can lead to glycogen storage diseases, it is less commonly associated with the clinical presentation described.\n\nGiven the elevated blood lactate levels and the absence of response to glucagon stimulation test, which are characteristic features of CHI, we can conclude that the most likely enzymatic defect present is related to glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency. This enzyme plays a critical role in the final step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, making it essential for glucose production in the liver.", "pred_ans": "C", "embedding": [-0.044425048,

{"idx": 1005, "question": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a well-child examination. At the visit, the mother says that she is worried about the child's vision because of an \u201ceye condition that runs in the family.\u201d She says that the child is doing well in all activities at his preschool, except one in which he is required to sort different colored balls into baskets of a corresponding color. A pedigree chart of the family, with the patient identified by a red arrow, is shown. The most likely cause of these changes in the patient's vision involves which of the following modes of inheritance?", "answer": "X-linked recessive", "options": {"A": "Mitochondrial inheritance", "B": "Autosomal recessive", "C": "Y-linked dominant", "D": "X-linked recessive"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo solve this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the scenario**: The child is experiencing vision problems that are exacerbated in one specific activity (sorting colored balls into baskets), which suggests a genetic component.\n\n2. **Pedigree chart analysis**: The pedigree chart shows the patient (red arrow) and his family members, with an \"eye condition\" indicated by a red arrow as well. This indicates that there is a possible genetic link to eye problems in this family.\n\n3. **Considering inheritance modes**:\n   - **Mitochondrial inheritance (A)**: Mitochondria are the energy-producing structures within cells. While mitochondrial diseases can be inherited, they typically affect only females and are not directly linked to eye conditions.\n   - **Autosomal recessive (B)**: This mode of inheritance means that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. However, this does not explain why the child's vision problems are specific to one activity.\n   - **Y-linked dominant (C)**: Y-linked traits are passed down through the Y chromosome. While some X-linked conditions can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, a Y-linked dominant trait would not typically affect eye color or vision directly.\n   - **X-linked recessive (D)**: This mode of inheritance involves genes on the X chromosome. The most common X-linked recessive condition is Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which affects boys more frequently than girls due to its X-linked nature.\n\n4. **Connecting the dots**: Given that the child's vision problems are specific to one activity and considering the options provided, the most likely cause of these changes in the patient's vision involves an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance. This is because X-linked conditions often affect males more frequently than females due to their single X chromosome.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [0.077917054, 0.077573515, 0.05722018,

{"idx": 1029, "question": "A pharmaceutical company has modified one of its existing antibiotics to have an improved toxicity profile. The new antibiotic blocks protein synthesis by first entering the cell and then binding to active ribosomes. The antibiotic mimics the structure of aminoacyl-tRNA. The drug is covalently bonded to the existing growing peptide chain via peptidyl transferase, thereby impairing the rest of protein synthesis and leading to early polypeptide truncation. Where is the most likely site that this process occurs?", "answer": "P site", "options": {"A": "40S small subunit", "B": "A site", "C": "E site", "D": "P site"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo solve this question, let's break down the key points provided:\n\n1. The antibiotic blocks protein synthesis by first entering the cell and then binding to active ribosomes.\n2. The antibiotic mimics the structure of aminoacyl-tRNA.\n\nGiven these details, we can infer that the process involves the interaction with ribosomal subunits. Let's analyze each option in relation to this information:\n\nA. 40S small subunit - This is a part of the ribosome where protein synthesis occurs, but it's not directly involved in binding to aminoacyl-tRNA or peptidyl transferase.\n\nB. A site - This could refer to any of the three sites on the ribosome (A, P, E), but there's no specific information that links this site to the antibiotic's mechanism of action.\n\nC. E site - The E site is where aminoacyl-tRNA binds during protein synthesis, and peptidyl transferase occurs after this step. However, the question states that the antibiotic \"mimics the structure of aminoacyl-tRNA,\" which suggests a more direct interaction with the ribosome rather than just binding to an existing tRNA.\n\nD. P site - The P site is where the growing peptide chain is attached by peptidyl transferase during protein synthesis. This process involves aminoacyl-tRNA, and the antibiotic's mechanism of action (binding to aminoacyl-tRNA and mimicking its structure) aligns with this step.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely site for the antibiotic's mechanism of action is the P site, where it binds to the growing peptide chain via peptidyl transferase, thereby impairing protein synthesis.\n\n## Answer Explanation:\nThe question describes an antibiotic that modifies protein synthesis by binding to aminoacyl-tRNA and mimicking its structure. This process occurs in the P site during protein synthesis. The antibiotic's mechanism of action is most consistent with this location because it directly interacts with the growing peptide chain, which is attached to peptidyl transferase at the P site.",

{"idx": 1054, "question": "A 61-year-old-male underwent deceased donor liver transplantation 3 weeks ago. During his follow up visit he complains of nausea and abdominal pain. He has been taking all of his medications as prescribed. He has a history of alcohol abuse and his last drink was one year ago. He does not smoke cigarettes and lives at home with his wife. On physical examination temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/80 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 18/min, and pulse oximetry is 99% on room air. He has scleral icterus and a positive fluid wave. Liver function tests are as follows:\n\nAlkaline phosphatase: 110 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST, GOT): 100 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT, GPT): 120 U/L\nBilirubin total: 2.2 mg/dL\n\nLiver biopsy shows mixed dense interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates in the portal triad. What is the mechanism of this reaction?", "answer": "CD8+ T lymphocytes reacting against donor MHCs", "options": {"A": "CD8+ T lymphocytes reacting against donor MHCs", "B": "CD4+ T lymphocytes reacting against recipient APCs", "C": "Pre-existing recipient antibodies", "D": "Grafted T lymphocytes reacting against host"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nThe mechanism behind the reaction in this patient can be explained by understanding the immune response to a graft.\n\nFirstly, let's consider the context: The patient has undergone deceased donor liver transplantation 3 weeks ago. This means that there is an immunological response against the graft, which is the transplanted organ.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. CD8+ T lymphocytes reacting against donor MHCs:\nCD8+ T cells are a type of cytotoxic T cell that can recognize and kill infected cells or tumor cells. In the context of transplantation, these cells can react against the graft, leading to an immune response.\n\nB. CD4+ T lymphocytes reacting against recipient APCs:\nCD4+ T cells are another type of helper T cell that play a crucial role in the adaptive immune response. They help activate other immune cells, such as B cells and cytotoxic T cells. However, they do not typically react directly against graft antigens.\n\nC. Pre-existing recipient antibodies:\nWhile it is possible for the patient to have pre-existing antibodies against the graft, this would likely be due to previous exposure to similar antigens or through immunological tolerance mechanisms.\n\nD. Grafted T lymphocytes reacting against host:\nThis option suggests that the reaction is directed against the patient's own tissues (the \"host\") rather than the graft itself. However, in the context of transplantation, it is more common for the immune system to react against the graft rather than the host.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely mechanism behind this reaction is the activation of CD8+ T lymphocytes reacting against donor MHCs. This is a common phenomenon in transplantation, where the immune system recognizes and responds to antigens presented by the graft's major histocompatibility complex (MHC).", "pred_ans": "A",

{"idx": 1063, "question": "A 5-year-old African American female has experienced recurrent respiratory infections. To determine how well her cell-mediated immunity is performing, a Candida skin injection is administered. After 48 hours, there is no evidence of induration at the injection site. Of the following cell types, which one would have mediated the reaction?", "answer": "T-cells", "options": {"A": "Basophils", "B": "T-cells", "C": "Mast cells", "D": "Fibroblasts"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the scenario**: The patient is a 5-year-old African American female with recurrent respiratory infections and has been administered a Candida skin injection. The reaction at the injection site is not indurated (not hardened), which suggests that there was no significant immune response.\n\n2. **Identifying the type of immune response**: Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is responsible for controlling intracellular pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, by killing infected cells or producing chemical signals that activate other immune responses. This type of immunity involves T-cells, which are a subset of lymphocytes.\n\n3. **Relating the scenario to cell types**:\n   - Basophils (A) are involved in inflammatory reactions and play a role in allergic responses, but they are not primarily responsible for cell-mediated immunity.\n   - Mast cells (C) release histamine and other mediators during anaphylaxis or allergic reactions, which is not relevant to this scenario.\n   - Fibroblasts (D) are connective tissue cells that produce collagen and other fibers, involved in wound healing and fibrosis, but they are not directly involved in cell-mediated immunity.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the absence of an indurated reaction at the injection site, which is indicative of a cell-mediated immune response, the most likely cell type responsible for this reaction is T-cells (B). Specifically, cytotoxic T-cells (CD8+ T-cells) are known to mediate cell killing and are involved in controlling viral infections.", "pred_ans": "B", "embedding": [0.027911093, 0.06946347,

While the cells are actively proliferating, the investigators stop the bacterial cell cycle during S phase and isolate an enzyme involved in DNA replication. An assay of the enzyme's exonuclease activity determines that it is active on both intact and demethylated thymine nucleotides. Which of the following enzymes have the investigators most likely isolated?", "answer": "DNA polymerase I", "options": {"A": "DNA ligase", "B": "Telomerase", "C": "DNA polymerase I", "D": "Primase"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nFirst, let's consider the properties of each enzyme mentioned in relation to thymine nucleotides:\n\n- **DNA Ligase**: This enzyme is responsible for sealing gaps between Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. It requires a 5'-phosphate group from one DNA strand and a 3'-hydroxyl group from another, which are not present on intact thymine nucleotides. Therefore, DNA ligase would be inactive on demethylated thymine nucleotides.\n  \n- **Telomerase**: This enzyme is involved in the maintenance of telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. It adds TTAGGG sequences to the ends of telomeres by extending the 3'-hydroxyl group from its catalytic site. Telomerase activity does not require demethylation of thymine nucleotides.\n  \n- **DNA Polymerase I**: This enzyme is a multi-processive polymerase that can synthesize DNA strands with varying lengths and sequences. It has exonuclease activity, which allows it to remove nucleotides from the 3' end of a growing DNA strand. However, its activity on demethylated thymine nucleotides is not characteristic.\n  \n- **Primase**: This enzyme is responsible for adding RNA primers to the template strands during initiation of DNA replication. It requires magnesium ions and ATP to function. Primase's activity does not involve the removal or modification of thymine nucleotides.\n\nGiven that the investigators isolated an enzyme with exonuclease activity on both intact and demethylated thymine nucleotides, we can conclude that this enzyme is most likely **DNA Polymerase I**. This is because DNA polymerase I has been shown to have exonuclease activity that can remove nucleotides from the 3' end of a growing DNA strand, regardless of whether they are intact or

{"idx": 1099, "question": "Three days after undergoing coronary bypass surgery, a 67-year-old man becomes unresponsive and hypotensive. He is intubated, mechanically ventilated, and a central line is inserted. Vasopressin and noradrenaline infusions are begun. A Foley catheter is placed. Six days later, he has high unrelenting fevers. He is currently receiving noradrenaline via an infusion pump. His temperature is 39.6\u00b0 (102.3\u00b0F), pulse is 113/min, and blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg. Examination shows a sternal wound with surrounding erythema; there is no discharge from the wound. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows an S3 gallop. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. A Foley catheter is present. His hemoglobin concentration is 10.8 g/dL, leukocyte count is 21,700/mm3, and platelet count is 165,000/mm3. Samples for blood culture are drawn simultaneously from the central line and peripheral IV line. Blood cultures from the central line show coagulase-negative cocci in clusters on the 8th postoperative day, and those from the peripheral venous line show coagulase-negative cocci in clusters on the 10th postoperative day. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?", "answer": "Central line-associated blood stream infection", "options": {"A": "Central line-associated blood stream infection", "B": "Catheter-associated urinary tract infection", "C": "Bowel ischemia", "D": "Surgical site infection"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nThe patient's presentation and laboratory findings suggest a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Timing**: The patient developed symptoms 6 days after surgery, which is within the typical timeframe for CLABSI to develop.\n2. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient's unresponsiveness, hypotension, and high fevers are non-specific but can be associated with sepsis or a severe infection.\n3. **Vasopressin and Noradrenaline Infusions**: These medications can increase vascular permeability and may contribute to the development of an infection by promoting bacterial growth in the central line.\n4. **Foley Catheter Placement**: The presence of a Foley catheter increases the risk of CLABSI, as it provides a direct pathway for bacteria to colonize and infect the device.\n5. **Blood Culture Results**: The coagulase-negative cocci found on both blood cultures from the central line and peripheral venous line are consistent with a bacterial infection, specifically Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus species.\n6. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient's leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) can be associated with sepsis or an invasive bacterial infection.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is CLABSI, as the presence of coagulase-negative cocci in clusters on both blood cultures supports this conclusion. The patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and risk factors for CLABSI make it the most probable diagnosis.", "pred_ans": "A", "embedding": [0.021066945, -0.0006053521, -0.034478113,

{"idx": 1137, "question": "A 21-year-old man presents to a physician because of extreme fatigue, palpitations, fever, and weight loss. He developed these symptoms gradually over the past 3 months. His blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 109/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, and temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F). The patient is emaciated and pale. There are conjunctival hemorrhages and several bruises noted in the inner cubital area bilaterally. There are also a few lesions on the left foot. The cardiac examination reveals a holosystolic murmur best heard at the 4th intercostal space at the left sternal edge. Two blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, and echocardiography shows a tricuspid valve aneurysm. Which of the following would most likely be revealed in a detailed history from this patient?", "answer": "Chronic intravenous drug usage", "options": {"A": "Lung abscess evacuation 3 months ago", "B": "Catheterization of the urinary bladder", "C": "Chronic intravenous drug usage", "D": "Adenoidectomy 6 months ago"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms, including extreme fatigue, palpitations, fever, weight loss, conjunctival hemorrhages, bruises, lesions on the foot, and a tricuspid valve aneurysm, along with the presence of a holosystolic murmur, it is essential to consider the potential causes of these symptoms. The patient's recent history of blood cultures growing Staphylococcus aureus also raises concern for endocarditis.\n\nThe patient's presentation suggests infective endocarditis, particularly given the tricuspid valve aneurysm and the presence of a holosystolic murmur. Endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is endocarditis.\n\nThe history that would most likely be revealed in a detailed medical history from this patient includes:\n\n- A history of intravenous drug use, as this increases the risk of developing endocarditis.\n- Catheterization of the urinary bladder, which could have led to bacteremia and subsequently endocarditis.\n- Chronic intravenous drug usage is a significant risk factor for developing endocarditis.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\n- Lung abscess evacuation 3 months ago would not directly explain the patient's current symptoms or the presence of a tricuspid valve aneurysm.\n- Adenoidectomy 6 months ago might be relevant if there were concerns about recurrent infections, but it is not directly

{"idx": 1141, "question": "A researcher is studying the ability of breast cancer cells to metastasize. Neoplastic cells obtained from 30 patients with stage IV ductal carcinoma of the breast are tagged with a fluorescent antibody. The cells are then inserted into a medium resembling normal human tissue. After 2 weeks, all samples show in vitro hematogenous invasion and migration away from the original site of insertion. Which of the following properties is most likely responsible for the ability of these neoplastic cells to metastasize?", "answer": "Release of matrix metalloproteinase", "options": {"A": "Loss of cellular polarity", "B": "Overexpression of HER2/neu", "C": "Presence of fibrous tissue capsule", "D": "Release of matrix metalloproteinase"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo address this question, let's analyze the given information and the properties listed as options.\n\nFirstly, we know that the neoplastic cells (breast cancer cells) have been tagged with a fluorescent antibody, which indicates they are labeled or \"tagged\" for detection. This suggests that these cells can be visualized using fluorescence microscopy, allowing researchers to track their movement and behavior in vitro.\n\nNext, we're told that after 2 weeks, all samples show in vitro hematogenous invasion and migration away from the original site of insertion. Hematogenous invasion refers to the process by which cancer cells enter the bloodstream and travel to distant sites in the body. Migration away from the original site is a key step in metastasis.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Loss of cellular polarity - While loss of cellular polarity can affect cell behavior, it is not directly related to hematogenous invasion or migration. In fact, many cancer cells exhibit increased motility and invasiveness despite having normal polarity.\n\nB. Overexpression of HER2/neu - HER2/neu is a protein that promotes the growth and spread of certain types of breast cancer. However, its overexpression is not directly linked to hematogenous invasion or migration in vitro.\n\nC. Presence of fibrous tissue capsule - A fibrous tissue capsule can provide structural support and protection for tumor cells, but it does not typically facilitate their movement through the bloodstream.\n\nD. Release of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - MMPs are a family of enzymes that break down the extracellular matrix, allowing cancer cells to invade surrounding tissues and migrate to distant sites. The release of MMPs is a key step in the metastatic process.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely property responsible for the ability of these neoplastic cells to metastasize is the release of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). This enzyme plays a critical role in breaking down the extracellular matrix, facilitating cell migration and invasion through tissues.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [0.045543548, -0.019898197,

{"idx": 1164, "question": "A 34-year-old man presents to the behavioral health clinic for an evaluation after seeing animal-shaped clouds in the form of dogs, cats, and monkeys. The patient says that these symptoms have been present for more than 2 weeks. Past medical history is significant for simple partial seizures for which he takes valproate, but he has not had his medication adjusted in several years. His vital signs include: blood pressure of 124/76 mm Hg, heart rate of 98/min, respiratory rate of 12/min, and temperature of 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F). On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented to person, time, and place. Affect is not constricted or flat. Speech is of rapid rate and high volume. Pupils are equal and reactive bilaterally. The results of a urine drug screen are as follows:\nAlcohol positive\nAmphetamine negative\nBenzodiazepine negative\nCocaine positive\nGHB negative\nKetamine negative\nLSD negative\nMarijuana negative\nOpioids negative\nPCP negative\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?", "answer": "Illusion", "options": {"A": "Cocaine intoxication", "B": "Illusion", "C": "Visual hallucination", "D": "Alcohol withdrawal"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the information provided, let's analyze the case step by step:\n\n1. **Symptoms and History**: The patient presents with a 2-week history of experiencing animal-shaped clouds (dogs, cats, monkeys) that he describes as having been present for more than two weeks. This symptom is crucial because it suggests a psychological or psychiatric condition rather than a physical one.\n\n2. **Past Medical History**: The patient has simple partial seizures and takes valproate for them. However, his medication has not been adjusted in several years, which might contribute to the development of his current symptoms but does not directly explain the animal-shaped clouds he is experiencing.\n\n3. **Vital Signs**: The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, indicating no acute distress or severe medical condition that could be causing his symptoms.\n\n4. **Physical Examination**: The physical examination is unremarkable, with no signs of neurological impairment, pain, or other systemic issues that might explain the animal-shaped clouds.\n\n5. **Urine Drug Screen Results**:\n   - Alcohol positive: This suggests possible alcohol use disorder but does not directly relate to the patient's current symptoms.\n   - Other substances (amphetamines, benzodiazepines, GHB, ketamine, LSD, marijuana, opioids, PCP) negative: These indicate that there is no clear indication of substance-induced psychosis or severe intoxication.\n\n6. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - Given the patient's symptoms and history, a psychiatric diagnosis seems more likely than a physical one.\n   - The presence of animal-shaped clouds (a classic symptom of schizophrenia) suggests a psychotic episode, which could be related to his past medical condition but is not directly explained by it.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Considering the above points, the most plausible explanation for the patient's symptoms is an illusion or hallucination related to his psychiatric history and current state. The animal-shaped clouds are likely a manifestation of his schizophrenia, possibly triggered by stress or anxiety due to his past medical issues and lack of medication adjustment.", "pred_ans": "B",

{"idx": 1171, "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of severe burning with urination for the past 3 days. During this period, he has had clear urethral discharge early in the morning. He has no history of serious illness, except for a rash following treatment with erythromycin 20 years ago. The patient takes no medications. He is sexually active with one male and one female partner; they use condoms inconsistently. His younger brother was diagnosed with Crohn disease at the age of 24 years. The patient does not smoke. He drinks one to two beers on weekends. He appears well. Temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98\u00b0F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 135/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Gram stain of a urethral swab shows neutrophils but no organisms. Which of the following is the most likely causal pathogen?", "answer": "Chlamydia trachomatis", "options": {"A": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae", "B": "Adenovirus", "C": "Trichomonas vaginalis", "D": "Chlamydia trachomatis"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can narrow down the possible causes.\n\nFirstly, the patient's history of a rash following treatment with erythromycin 20 years ago is an important clue. Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is known to cause a rare condition called \"macrolide-induced interstitial nephritis,\" which can lead to chronic kidney disease and potentially affect the urinary tract.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of severe burning with urination, clear urethral discharge early in the morning, and Gram stain showing neutrophils but no organisms are highly suggestive of a sexually transmitted infection (STI).\n\nConsidering the patient's sexual activity with inconsistent condom use, we should also consider STIs that are more common in this population.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a common cause of urethritis and can cause severe symptoms, including burning during urination. However, it typically causes purulent discharge, which is not mentioned in the patient's description.\n\nB. Adenovirus can cause urethritis and other urinary tract infections, but it is less commonly associated with the symptoms described.\n\nC. Trichomonas vaginalis is a common cause of vaginitis and urethritis in sexually active women, but it typically causes a purulent discharge and is not consistent with the patient's description.\n\nD. Chlamydia trachomatis is a leading cause of STIs worldwide, including urethritis and epididymitis. It can be transmitted through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and its symptoms match those described in the patient.\n\nGiven the patient's history of erythromycin use and the presence of clear urethral discharge with neutrophils but no organisms on Gram stain, Chlamydia trachomatis is the most likely causal pathogen. Additionally, the patient's sexual activity with inconsistent condom use increases his risk for other STIs.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [0.08191721, -0.01594316, -0.024207639, 0.03728816,

He denies any major side effects from the treatment, except for the inconvenience of organizing transportation to a physician's office every month.

Which of the following is the next best step?", "answer": "Continue intramuscular penicillin therapy", "options": {"A": "Stop penicillin therapy in 4 years", "B": "Decrease frequency of injections to bimonthly", "C": "Switch to intramuscular cefotaxime, which has fewer side effects", "D": "Continue intramuscular penicillin therapy"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's history of rheumatic heart disease and his current compliance with monthly penicillin G injections, it is essential to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of continuing this treatment.\n\nFirstly, the patient reports no major side effects from the penicillin therapy. However, the inconvenience of organizing transportation to a physician's office every month may be a significant concern for someone with limited mobility or other health issues.\n\nThe physical examination findings of a loud first heart sound (S1) and a mid-diastolic rumble that is best heard at the apex are classic signs of mitral stenosis, which can be caused by rheumatic fever. Mitral stenosis is a complication of rheumatic heart disease and can lead to significant morbidity if left untreated.\n\nConsidering these factors, the next best step would be to assess the patient's current penicillin G therapy for any potential contraindications or alternatives that could improve his quality of life while minimizing risks.\n\nOption A (Stop penicillin therapy in 4 years) is not recommended because it does not address the underlying issue and may lead to a delay in addressing potential complications of rheumatic heart disease, such as mitral stenosis.\n\nOption B (Decrease frequency of injections to bimonthly) might be considered if the patient's symptoms were significantly improving or if he was experiencing significant side effects. However, this option does not address the underlying condition and may lead to a decrease in adherence to treatment.\n\nOption C (Switch to intramuscular cefotaxime, which has fewer side effects) is not recommended because it introduces a new medication with unknown long-term effects on the patient's rheumatic heart disease and mitral stenosis. Additionally, switching medications without proper evaluation may lead to inadequate treatment of the underlying condition.\n\nOption D (Continue intramuscular penicillin therapy) is the most appropriate next step. It allows for continued monitoring of the patient's symptoms and potential development of complications, while also ensuring that he remains compliant with his current treatment regimen. Regular follow-up appointments can help identify any changes in his condition or side effects, allowing for adjustments to be made as needed.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [0.013287583, 0.006617512,

{"idx": 1212, "question": "A 34-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of a rash on the elbows for several months. A biopsy of the affected area shows a thinned stratum granulosum as well as retained nuclei and spongiotic clusters of neutrophils in the stratum corneum. This patient's skin findings are most likely associated with which of the following conditions?", "answer": "Seronegative spondylarthropathy", "options": {"A": "Seronegative spondylarthropathy", "B": "Hypersensitivity to gliadin", "C": "Infection with hepatitis C virus", "D": "Insulin resistance"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo approach this question, let's analyze the key findings from the biopsy and their implications for the patient's condition.\n\n1. **Thinned stratum granulosum**: This finding is indicative of a skin condition that affects the outermost layer of the skin, which is responsible for barrier function and hydration.\n2. **Retained nuclei**: The presence of retained nuclei in the epidermis suggests an abnormal proliferation or hyperplasia of keratinocytes, leading to an increase in cell size beyond what is typically seen in normal skin.\n3. **Spongiotic clusters of neutrophils in the stratum corneum**: Spongiosis refers to the accumulation of fluid within the epidermal layer, which can be a response to various insults, including infections or inflammatory conditions.\n\nGiven these findings, let's evaluate each answer choice:\n\nA. **Seronegative spondylarthropathy**: This condition is characterized by inflammation in multiple joints and sometimes skin lesions, but it typically does not present with the specific histopathological features mentioned (thinned stratum granulosum, retained nuclei, and spongiotic clusters of neutrophils).\n\nB. **Hypersensitivity to gliadin**: Gliadin is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. While an immune reaction to gliadin can cause skin symptoms, the specific histopathological findings mentioned do not align with typical hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nC. **Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV)**: HCV infection can lead to various skin manifestations, including liver disease and skin conditions like lipodystrophy or cutaneous tuberculosis. However, the biopsy findings described are more suggestive of a direct skin condition rather than an infectious process.\n\nD. **Insulin resistance**: Insulin resistance is a condition associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which can lead to skin changes such as acanthosis nigricans, but it does not typically present with the specific histopathological features mentioned (thinned stratum granulosum, retained nuclei, and spongiotic clusters of neutrophils).\n\nConsidering these factors, the most likely condition associated with the patient's skin findings is **A. Seronegative spondylarthropathy**, as it can present with a variety of skin manifestations, including those described in the biopsy results.", "pred_ans": "A", "embedding": [0.01685274, 0.0033477729,

However, it may also have systemic side effects, such as weight gain, mood changes, and increased risk of osteoporosis.\n\nC. **Pilocarpine**: A medication used to treat glaucoma by reducing intraocular pressure. It is not a primary treatment for vascular or inflammatory conditions.\n\nD. **Clopidogrel**: An antiplatelet agent that reduces the risk of blood clots but does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\nGiven the information, the best choice for treating this patient would be to reduce inflammation and swelling, which is most effectively achieved with corticosteroids like prednisone. This treatment option addresses both the elevated ESR and the visual field deficit, making it a more comprehensive approach to managing the patient's condition.", "pred_ans": "B", "embedding":

To address this question, let's consider the mechanism by which minocycline could be toxic to the fetus.\n\nMinocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that can bind to calcium ions and inhibit bone growth, leading to tooth discoloration (gray coloring of the skin) in children and adolescents. This effect is reversible upon discontinuation of the medication.\n\nGiven this mechanism, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\nA. Inhibition of bone growth - This is the correct mechanism by which minocycline can be toxic to the fetus.\nB. Atrialization of the ventricle - This refers to a condition where the heart muscle becomes stiff and cannot function properly. It is not related to minocycline's potential toxicity to the fetus.\nC. Scarring of the bile ducts - While certain medications can cause scarring in various organs, this is not a known mechanism by which minocycline would be toxic to the fetus.\nD. Gray coloring of the skin - This refers to tooth discoloration caused by minocycline in children and adolescents. It is not relevant to its potential toxicity to the fetus.", "pred_ans": "A", "embedding": [0.0049834033, 0.02729068, -0.082631685, 0.094047785, -0.0060387934, 0.005610005, 0.038859904, 0.13118856,

{"idx": 1299, "question": "A 13-year-old boy is brought to a physician with severe fevers and headaches for 3 days. The pain is constant and mainly behind the eyes. He has myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and a rash for one day. Last week, during an academic winter break, he traveled on a tour with his family to several countries, including Brazil, Panama, and Peru. They spent many evenings outdoors without any protection against insect bites. There is no history of contact with pets, serious illness, or use of medications. The temperature is 40.0\u2103 (104.0\u2109); the pulse is 110/min; the respiratory rate is 18/min, and the blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. A maculopapular rash is seen over the trunk and extremities. Several tender lymph nodes are palpated in the neck on both sides. A peripheral blood smear shows no organisms. Which of the following is most likely responsible for this patient\u2019s presentation?", "answer": "Dengue fever", "options": {"A": "Babesiosis", "B": "Chagas disease", "C": "Dengue fever", "D": "Malaria"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nThe patient presents with a combination of symptoms that are suggestive of an infectious disease, particularly one that affects the hematological system and has a vector-borne etiology.\n\nFirstly, the patient's history of traveling to several countries during academic winter break increases the likelihood of exposure to tick-borne pathogens. The presence of a maculopapular rash over the trunk and extremities is consistent with rickettsial infections, which are transmitted by ticks.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of severe fevers, headaches, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and a rash are also suggestive of an infectious disease caused by a tick-borne pathogen. The presence of tender lymph nodes in the neck further supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe peripheral blood smear showing no organisms is not diagnostic on its own but suggests that the patient's infection may be at an early stage or has been treated effectively, which could explain why the organism was not detected.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\nA. Babesiosis - This is a tick-borne disease caused by Babesia parasites, typically transmitted through the bite of infected ticks. It presents with fever, headache, and anemia, but it does not typically cause a rash or lymphadenopathy.\n\nB. Chagas disease - This is a tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by triatomine bugs (kissing bugs). While it can affect the hematological system, it typically presents with more systemic symptoms such as fatigue, muscle pain, and gastrointestinal disturbances, rather than the specific combination of symptoms seen in this patient.\n\nC. Dengue fever - This is a mosquito-borne viral disease that causes severe flu-like symptoms, including high fever, headache, myalgias, and rash. However, it does not typically cause lymphadenopathy or anemia as described in this patient.\n\nD. Malaria - This is another mosquito-borne disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, which can affect the hematological system. It presents with fever, chills, flu-like symptoms, and anemia, but it does not typically cause a rash or lymphadenopathy.\n\nBased on the analysis of the patient's symptoms and travel history, the most likely diagnosis is tick-borne rickettsial infection, which is consistent with Dengue fever.", "pred_ans": "C", "embedding": [0.037105035, 0.011937159, 0.05545194, 0.015421587, 0.026804117,

{"idx": 1301, "question": "A 22-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of fever and altered mentation. He reports fever without chills and rigors and denies sore throat, abdominal pain, headache, loose stool, burning micturition, or seizures. He has a history of tics and is currently on a low dose of haloperidol. At the hospital, his temperature is 39.6\u00b0C (103.2\u00b0F); the blood pressure is 126/66 mm Hg, and the pulse is 116/min. He is profusely sweating and generalized rigidity is present. He is confused and disoriented. He is able to move all his limbs. Normal deep tendon reflexes are present with bilateral downgoing plantar responses. A brain MRI is unremarkable. Urine toxicology is negative. The white blood cell count is 14,700/mm3. Creatine kinase is 5600 U/L. Lumbar puncture is performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies show:\nCSF opening pressure 22 cm H20\nCSF white blood cells 4 cells/mm3\nCSF red blood cells 0 cells/mm3\nCSF glucose 64 mg/dL\nCSF protein 48 mg/dL\nSerum glucose 96 mg/dL\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?", "answer": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome", "options": {"A": "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis", "B": "Encephalitis", "C": "Meningitis", "D": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation, history, and laboratory findings, we can analyze the information step by step to arrive at a diagnosis.\n\n1. **Fever and altered mentation without specific symptoms**: The patient's fever and altered mentation could be indicative of various conditions, including infections, encephalitis, or even neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).\n\n2. **History of tics and current low dose of haloperidol**: Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic medication known to cause extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), which can include tics. The patient's history of tics suggests that the EPS caused by haloperidol could be contributing to his symptoms.\n\n3. **Normal CSF studies and low white blood cell count**: The unremarkable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, including normal opening pressure, low white blood cell count, and absence of red blood cells, help to rule out acute bacterial meningitis or encephalitis, which typically present with elevated white blood cell counts.\n\n4. **High creatine kinase levels**: Elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels can indicate muscle damage, which is consistent with the patient's tics and potential EPS caused by haloperidol.\n\n5. **Normal CSF glucose and protein levels**: The normal CSF glucose and protein levels help to rule out bacterial meningitis or encephalitis, as these conditions typically present with abnormal glucose and protein levels in the CSF.\n\n6. **Negative urine toxicology and low serum glucose**: The negative urine toxicology result helps to rule out drug-induced psychosis or other toxic causes of altered mentation. The normal serum glucose level also supports this diagnosis.\n\n7. **Lumbar puncture findings**: Although the lumbar puncture is unremarkable, it's essential to note that a normal CSF analysis does not rule out CNS infections or inflammation.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely diagnosis is Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). NMS is characterized by fever, altered mentation, muscle rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction, often in patients taking antipsychotic medications like haloperidol. The patient's history of tics, EPS, and current medication regimen support this diagnosis.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [0.013885261, -0.029882526, -0.033805367, -0.024615014, -0.12267967,

The patient also reports a weight loss of 10 lbs during this time, without a change in her appetite. She denies fatigue, cough, hoarseness, pain, or hemoptysis. The patient has a history of childhood lymphoma, which was treated with radiation. She takes no medications. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day since she was 25 years old. Her physical exam is notable for a palpable nodule on the right side of the thyroid. An ultrasound is performed, which confirms a 1.2 cm hyperechoic nodule in the right lobe. Thyroid function labs are drawn and shown below:\n\nSerum TSH: 0.2 mU/L\nSerum thyroxine (T4): 187 nmol/L\nSerum triiodothyronine (T3): 3.3 nmol/L\n\nWhich of the following is the next best step in management?", "answer": "Thyroid scintigraphy", "options": {"A": "Levothyroxine", "B": "Partial thyroidectomy", "C": "Radioactive iodine", "D": "Thyroid scintigraphy"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including a palpable nodule on the right side of the thyroid and an ultrasound confirmation of a 1.2 cm hyperechoic nodule in the right lobe, the most likely diagnosis is a thyroid adenoma or follicular neoplasm.\n\nThe elevated serum TSH level (0.2 mU/L) suggests that the patient's thyroid gland may be producing too much thyroid hormone, which could be due to an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). The low serum T4 and T3 levels further support this diagnosis, as they are typically decreased in hyperthyroidism.\n\nThe patient's history of childhood lymphoma treated with radiation increases the risk for developing a thyroid adenoma or follicular neoplasm. However, the current ultrasound findings do not suggest an invasive cancer, which would be more likely to cause symptoms such as weight loss and fatigue.\n\nGiven these considerations, the next best step in management is to confirm the diagnosis of a thyroid adenoma or follicular neoplasm without causing unnecessary harm to the patient. \n\nA. Levothyroxine - This is not appropriate as the initial treatment for hyperthyroidism, as it would mask the symptoms and potentially worsen the condition.\n\nB. Partial thyroidectomy - While this could be considered in some cases of thyroid adenoma or follicular neoplasm, it is not typically the first step in management, especially without further diagnostic testing to confirm the nature of the nodule.\n\nC. Radioactive iodine - This is a potential treatment option for hyperthyroidism caused by an overactive thyroid gland, but it would require careful consideration and monitoring due to the risk of hypothyroidism and other complications.\n\nD. Thyroid scintigraphy (also known as a thyroid scan) - This is the most appropriate next step in management. It can help confirm the diagnosis of a thyroid adenoma or follicular neoplasm, assess its size and location, and evaluate for any potential invasion into surrounding tissues.

{"idx": 1356, "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of abdominal pain, a runny nose, and chills for 6 hours. He has also had diarrhea and difficulty sleeping. He appears irritable. His temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Examination shows cool, damp skin with piloerection. The pupils are 7 mm in diameter and equal in size. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is tender to palpation. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Withdrawal from which of the following substances is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?", "answer": "Heroin", "options": {"A": "Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid", "B": "Cannabis", "C": "Phencyclidine", "D": "Heroin"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation, including abdominal pain, runny nose, chills, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, irritability, cool and damp skin with piloerection, dilated pupils (7 mm in diameter), hyperactive bowel sounds, deep tendon reflexes 3+ bilaterally, and tender abdomen, we can deduce that the patient is experiencing a condition known as Sydenham's chorea, which is often associated with rheumatic fever.\n\nSydenham's chorea is characterized by a combination of neurological and musculoskeletal symptoms. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is an infection, specifically rheumatic fever, which can be triggered by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) infection.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid - This is a short-acting barbiturate used as a sedative and hypnotic. It is not typically associated with Sydenham's chorea or rheumatic fever.\n\nB. Cannabis - While cannabis can cause various symptoms, including altered perception and mood changes, it is not directly linked to the development of Sydenham's chorea or rheumatic fever.\n\nC. Phencyclidine (PCP) - PCP is a dissociative anesthetic that can cause hallucinations, disorientation, and altered mental status but is not typically associated with Sydenham's chorea or rheumatic fever.\n\nD. Heroin - Heroin is an opioid that can cause various symptoms including respiratory depression, constipation, and sedation. However, it is not directly linked to the development of Sydenham's chorea or rheumatic fever.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and the potential triggers for these symptoms (e.g., GABHS infection), the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is an infection such as streptococcal pharyngitis, which can lead to rheumatic fever. Therefore, withdrawal from heroin would not be a direct cause of Sydenham's chorea or rheumatic fever.", "pred_ans": "D", "embedding": [0.016159277, -0.094347425, -0.008329257, 0.09029029,

{"idx": 1363, "question": "A 65-year-old woman comes to the clinic for an annual well-check. Her past medical history includes diabetes and hypertension, which are well-controlled with metformin and losartan, respectively. The patient reports a healthy diet consisting of mainly vegetables and lean meat. She denies smoking or alcohol use. She enjoys taking walks with her husband and sunbathing. Physical examination is unremarkable expect for a rough, scaly, sand paper-like plaque on her left dorsal hand with no tenderness or pain. What is the most likely diagnosis?", "answer": "Actinic keratosis", "options": {"A": "Actinic keratosis", "B": "Psoriasis", "C": "Rosacea", "D": "Seborrheic keratosis"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's age, medical history, and physical examination findings, we can consider several potential diagnoses.\n\nFirstly, the presence of a rough, scaly, sand paper-like plaque on her left dorsal hand is highly suggestive of Actinic Keratosis (AK). AKs are a common skin condition that occurs in people with fair skin who spend time outdoors, especially those exposed to the sun. They are caused by damage to the skin from UV radiation and can progress to squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated.\n\nThe fact that the patient denies smoking or alcohol use makes tobacco-related and alcohol-related causes of AKs less likely. Additionally, her diet consists mainly of vegetables and lean meat, which is not typically associated with an increased risk of AKs.\n\nPsoriasis (B) is a chronic skin condition characterized by red, scaly patches on the skin. While it can occur in people with fair skin, it is more commonly seen in individuals with darker skin types. Rosacea (C) and Seborrheic Keratosis (D) are less likely given the patient's age and the specific description of the plaque.\n\nGiven these considerations, Actinic Keratosis is the most likely diagnosis.\n\n## Answer Explanation\nThe presence of a rough, scaly, sand paper-like plaque on the hand is highly suggestive of AKs. The fact that the patient has fair skin and spends time outdoors increases her risk for developing AKs. While other conditions can cause similar symptoms, the combination of these factors points towards AKs as the most likely diagnosis.", "pred_ans": "A", "embedding": [-0.03058357, -0.011065695,

In other words, one virus \"completes\" the other by providing its necessary genetic material.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Hepatitis D (HDV) is a unique virus that requires hepatitis B (HBV) to replicate.\n- When HDV was injected into an immunocompromised mouse, it could not replicate on its own and therefore did not produce detectable hepatitis D RNA in the blood.\n- However, when co-injected with HBV, HDV was able to complete its replication by providing its necessary genetic material.\n\nThe key point here is that HDV relies on HBV for completion, which is a characteristic of complementation. This means that the two viruses can work together to produce a complete viral genome, even though they are distinct and cannot replicate independently.", "pred_ans": "C", "embedding": [0.006902163,

Protamine sulfate - This medication is used to reverse the anticoagulant effects of heparin. However, in this case, the patient has been on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for five months and only received a subcutaneous dose during chemotherapy. Therefore, protamine sulfate would not have prevented his current condition.\n\nB. Mercaptoethane sulfonate - This is an antifolate medication used to treat certain types of cancer, including lymphoma. It works by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which is necessary for DNA synthesis and cell division. Given the patient's recent chemotherapy, mercaptoethane sulfonate could have potentially prevented his current condition.\n\nC. Ciprofloxacin - This antibiotic is used to treat bacterial infections. There is no indication in the provided information that the patient has a bacterial infection or that ciprofloxacin would be effective against his current condition.\n\nD. Dexrazoxane - This medication is used to prevent cardiotoxicity associated with anthracycline chemotherapy agents, such as doxorubicin. While it's true that the patient received chemotherapy 2 weeks ago, there is no indication that dexrazoxane was administered in this case.\n\nConsidering these options and the patient's history,

{"idx": 1439, "question": "A 31-year-old man is referred to a neurologist due to his gradually increasing eccentric behavior and involuntary movements, especially the movements of his arms and hands. He also has difficulty with his short-term memory. Past medical history is otherwise noncontributory. His father had similar symptoms before he died but those symptoms started at the age of 33. His blood pressure is 125/92 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature is 36.6\u00b0C (97.9\u00b0F). Physical exam reveals involuntary writhing movements of hands, slow eye movements, and sporadic rigidity. The physician explains that this is an inherited disorder where the symptoms occur progressively at an earlier age than the parent and often with increased severity in the future generations. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?", "answer": "Huntington's disease", "options": {"A": "Huntington's disease", "B": "Friedreich ataxia", "C": "Wilson's disease", "D": "Neurofibromatosis"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the symptoms described for the 31-year-old man, including gradually increasing eccentric behavior and involuntary movements (such as writhing hands), difficulty with short-term memory, physical exam findings of slow eye movements and sporadic rigidity, and a family history of similar symptoms starting at an earlier age, we can consider several inherited disorders that could cause these symptoms.\n\nFirstly, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Huntington's disease: This is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by progressive damage to the brain, leading to cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and psychiatric problems. The symptoms described in the question match closely with those of Huntington's disease, including involuntary movements (chorea), difficulty with short-term memory, and physical findings such as slow eye movements and rigidity.\n\nB. Friedreich ataxia: This is an autosomal recessive disorder that primarily affects the nervous system, leading to progressive damage to the spinal cord, brain, and peripheral nerves. While it can cause involuntary movements (ataxia), it typically starts in adolescence or early adulthood, which does not match this patient's age.\n\nC. Wilson's disease: This is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a genetic mutation that leads to copper accumulation in the body, particularly in the liver, brain, and other organs. While it can cause neurological symptoms such as tremors and coordination problems, it typically starts in adulthood, which does not match this patient's age.\n\nD. Neurofibromatosis: This is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the growth of noncancerous tumors on nerve tissue, particularly in the brain or spinal cord. While it can cause neurological symptoms such as headaches and sensitivity to light, it typically starts in childhood or adolescence, which does not match this patient's age.\n\nConsidering these factors, Huntington's disease is the most likely diagnosis for this patient due to its characteristic progressive damage to the brain, matching the described symptoms, and the family history of similar symptoms starting at an earlier age.", "pred_ans": "A", "embedding": [0.02290141, 0.0032500206, 0.021178517, 0.062200196, -0.08406472, -0.031762198, 0.009045583, -0.013679837, -0.09760587,

{"idx": 1446, "question": "A 75-year-old Caucasian man presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain. The patient states he was at home eating dinner when he began to experience severe abdominal pain. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. He lives at home alone, smokes cigarettes, and drinks 1 to 2 alcoholic drinks per day. The patient is given IV morphine and an ultrasound is obtained demonstrating a dilated abdominal aorta. The patient states that his father died of a similar finding and is concerned about his prognosis. Which of the following is the greatest risk factor for this patient's presentation?", "answer": "Cigarette smoking", "options": {"A": "Atherosclerosis", "B": "Caucasian race", "C": "Cigarette smoking", "D": "Family history"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation with severe abdominal pain, dilated abdominal aorta on ultrasound, and family history of similar findings, we need to consider the potential causes and risk factors.\n\nFirstly, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Atherosclerosis: This is a significant risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), which can lead to severe abdominal pain. However, it is not directly related to the dilated abdominal aorta seen on ultrasound.\n\nB. Caucasian race: While there may be some association between certain ethnicities and AAA, this is not the greatest risk factor in this case.\n\nC. Cigarette smoking: Smoking is a well-established risk factor for AAA, as it damages the inner lining of blood vessels and increases blood pressure, both of which can contribute to aneurysm formation.\n\nD. Family history: While having a family history of AAA may increase the patient's risk, it is not as strong a risk factor as smoking.\n\nConsidering these factors, the greatest risk factor for this patient's presentation is cigarette smoking (C). The patient's father died of a similar finding, suggesting a possible genetic component to his condition.

{"idx": 1532, "question": "A 61-year-old woman presents to her primary care doctor with her son who reports that his mother is not acting like herself. She has gotten lost while driving several times in the past 2 months and appears to be talking to herself frequently. Of note, the patient\u2019s husband died from a stroke 4 months ago. The patient reports feeling sad and guilty for causing so much trouble for her son. Her appetite has decreased since her husband died. On examination, she is oriented to person, place, and time. She is inattentive, and her speech is disorganized. She shakes her hand throughout the exam without realizing it. Her gait is slow and appears unstable. This patient\u2019s condition would most likely benefit from which of the following medications?", "answer": "Rivastigmine", "options": {"A": "Bromocriptine", "B": "Reserpine", "C": "Rivastigmine", "D": "Selegiline"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms, including disorganized speech, inattentiveness, slow and unstable gait, and decreased appetite following her husband's death, it is likely that she is experiencing symptoms of dementia or a neurodegenerative disorder. The presence of these symptoms, particularly in the context of recent bereavement, suggests that the patient may be suffering from depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can co-occur with dementia.\n\nThe medications listed are used to treat various conditions, including:\n\nA. Bromocriptine - primarily used to treat Parkinson's disease and hyperprolactinemia.\nB. Reserpine - an antipsychotic medication that has been used to treat schizophrenia and certain types of depression.\nC. Rivastigmine - a cholinesterase inhibitor used to treat mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.\nD. Selegiline - an MAO-B inhibitor used to treat Parkinson's disease.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms, which include disorganized speech, inattentiveness, and decreased appetite, as well as her recent bereavement, the most likely condition she is experiencing is dementia or a neurodegenerative disorder. Given these symptoms, the medication that would most likely benefit from treatment is Rivastigmine (C), as it is specifically used to treat mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.", "pred_ans": "C",

{"idx": 1536, "question": "A 35-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after experiencing a seizure. According to his girlfriend, he has had fatigue for the last 3 days and became confused this morning, after which he started having uncontrollable convulsions throughout his entire body. He was unconscious throughout the episode, which lasted about 4 minutes. He has not visited a physician for over 10 years. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 12 years. His girlfriend admits they occasionally use heroin together with their friends. His temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (101.8\u00b0F), pulse is 93/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation and examination shows normal heart sounds and no carotid or femoral bruits. He appears emaciated and somnolent. There are multiple track marks on both his arms. He is unable to cooperate for a neurological exam. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 3,000/mm3, a hematocrit of 34%, a platelet count of 354,000/mm3, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 27 mm/h. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 84/mm3 (normal \u2265 500). A CT scan of the head is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step considering this patient's CT scan findings?", "answer": "Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin", "options": {"A": "Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin", "B": "CT-guided stereotactic aspiration", "C": "Albendazole", "D": "Glucocorticoids"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation of a seizure, recent onset of fatigue, confusion, and convulsions, along with his medical history including smoking and heroin use, we need to consider potential causes for his symptoms that could be related to his immunocompromised state.\n\nThe CT scan findings are not explicitly described in the question, but based on the provided information, it is likely that the scan shows evidence of a parasitic infection given the patient's track marks and emaciated appearance. The most common parasitic infections affecting individuals with weakened immune systems include malaria, toxoplasmosis, and hydatid disease.\n\nConsidering these factors, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\nA. Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin - This combination is typically used to treat toxoplasmosis, which is a parasitic infection caused by Toxoplasma gondii. Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, this option seems highly relevant.\n\nB. CT-guided stereotactic aspiration - While this could be a diagnostic procedure for certain conditions, it does not directly address the potential underlying cause of the patient's symptoms based on his immunocompromised state and parasitic infection history.\n\nC. Albendazole - This is an antiparasitic medication that can be used to treat various parasitic infections, including those caused by Toxoplasma gondii. However, it may not be as effective in treating toxoplasmosis as pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin.\n\nD. Glucocorticoids - These are anti-inflammatory medications that can be used to treat various conditions, including some parasitic infections. However, they would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms or provide a specific treatment for toxoplasmosis.\n\nGiven the patient's presentation and medical history, the most appropriate next step is to use pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin (A) to treat potential toxoplasmosis. This combination is specifically used to treat Toxoplasma gondii infections in immunocompromised patients.", "pred_ans": "A", "embedding": [0.042923532, -0.0034543257, -0.041224357, 0.032393977,

{"idx": 1557, "question": "A 43-year-old male visits the emergency room around 4 weeks after getting bitten by a bat during a cave diving trip. After cleansing the wound with water, the patient reports that he felt well enough not to seek medical attention immediately following his trip. He does endorse feeling feverish in the past week but a new onset of photophobia and irritability led him to seek help today. What would the post-mortem pathology report show if the patient succumbs to this infection?", "answer": "Negri bodies", "options": {"A": "Psammoma bodies", "B": "Pick bodies", "C": "Negri bodies", "D": "Howell-Jolly bodies"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the scenario, the most likely cause of death in this case is rabies. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Rabies exposure**: The patient was bitten by a bat during a cave diving trip, which increases his risk of contracting rabies.\n2. **Delayed medical attention**: Despite feeling feverish for a week, the patient did not seek immediate medical attention, suggesting that he may have been in a state of altered mental status or had difficulty communicating his symptoms.\n3. **Symptoms leading to seeking help**: The new onset of photophobia (sensitivity to light) and irritability led him to seek medical attention.\n4. **Rabies post-mortem pathology**: In rabies, the hallmark histopathological feature is the presence of Negri bodies in the neurons of the brain.\n\nNegri bodies are eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusions that contain a protein called rabies virus glycoprotein A. They are typically found in the neurons of animals infected with rabies and are a diagnostic hallmark of the disease.\n\nTherefore, if the patient succumbs to this infection, the post-mortem pathology report would show Negri bodies in the brain tissue.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the clinical presentation or the typical histopathological findings of rabies:\n\n- Psammoma bodies are associated with certain types of tumors, such as papillary thyroid carcinoma.\n- Pick bodies are characteristic of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.\n- Howell-Jolly bodies are small, round inclusions found in red blood cells due to a deficiency in the enzyme responsible for removing them from the spleen. They are not associated with rabies or any other infectious diseases.", "pred_ans": "C", "embedding": [0.025984112, 0.022032045, -0.0016268713, 0.041407198, -0.0061264015, -0.08060186, 0.008409382,

{"idx": 1565, "question": "A 26-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife because of bizarre and agitated behavior for the last 6 weeks. He thinks that the NSA is spying on him and controlling his mind. His wife reports that the patient has become withdrawn and at times depressed for the past 3 months. He lost his job because he stopped going to work 4 weeks ago. Since then, he has been working on an invention that will block people from being able to control his mind. Physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he is confused and suspicious with marked psychomotor agitation. His speech is disorganized and his affect is labile. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "answer": "Schizophreniform disorder", "options": {"A": "Schizophreniform disorder", "B": "Schizophrenia", "C": "Brief psychotic disorder", "D": "Schizotypal personality disorder"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms, which include bizarre and agitated behavior for 6 weeks, withdrawal and depression for 3 months, loss of job due to mental health issues, physical and neurologic examinations showing no abnormalities, and specific symptoms such as confusion, suspiciousness, psychomotor agitation, disorganized speech, and labile affect, the most likely diagnosis is Schizophreniform Disorder.\n\nSchizophreniform disorder is characterized by a duration of at least 1 month but less than 6 months of symptoms that meet the criteria for schizophrenia. The patient's symptoms, such as delusions (thinking the NSA is spying on him), hallucinations (he thinks he can control his mind), disorganized speech and behavior, and psychomotor agitation, are all consistent with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.\n\nThe fact that the patient has been working on an invention to block people from controlling his mind may be related to his delusions or hallucinations, which could indicate a psychotic feature. However, this is not sufficient to meet the full criteria for schizophrenia, and therefore, Schizophreniform Disorder is the most appropriate diagnosis.\n\nIn contrast, Schizophrenia typically requires at least 6 months of symptoms before a diagnosis can be made. Brief Psychotic Disorder involves an episode of psychosis lasting less than 1 month, which does not fit this patient's duration of symptoms. Schizotypal Personality Disorder involves persistent patterns of social and interpersonal deficits that begin in childhood and are marked by eccentricities of behavior or thought, but it is not consistent with the patient's bizarre and agitated behavior.", "pred_ans": "A", "embedding": [0.026912255, -0.002729639, -0.026199041, 0.019695582, -0.0530845, -0.0038846172, 0.1182654, -0.027366133,

{"idx": 1570, "question": "A 9-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of diarrhea and vomiting for the last 2 days. During this period, he has had about 12 watery, non-bloody bowel movements and has vomited three times. He came back from a trip to India 3 days ago, where he and his family were visiting relatives. He has not been able to eat anything since the symptoms started. The patient has not urinated since yesterday. He appears pale. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 96/60 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The abdomen is soft with no organomegaly. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 13 g/dL\nSerum\nNa+ 148 mEq/L\nCl- 103 mEq/L\nK+ 3.7 mEq/L\nHCO3- 19 mEq/L\nUrea nitrogen 80 mg/dL\nGlucose 90 mg/dL\nCreatinine 2 mg/dL\nIntravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's abnormal renal laboratory findings?\"", "answer": "Decreased renal perfusion", "options": {"A": "Decreased renal perfusion", "B": "IgA complex deposition", "C": "Glomerulonephritis", "D": "Urinary tract obstruction"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and laboratory findings in this 9-year-old boy, we can analyze the possible causes step by step:\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with diarrhea, vomiting, inability to eat or drink since the last few days, pale appearance, fever (38\u00b0C), tachycardia (106/min), hypotension (96/60 mm Hg), and dehydration indicated by dry mucous membranes and decreased urine output. These symptoms suggest a severe systemic infection.\n\n2. **Recent Travel**: The patient recently returned from India, where he visited relatives. This is crucial because certain infections are more common in specific geographic regions or during specific times of the year.\n\n3. **Laboratory Findings**:\n   - Low hemoglobin (13 g/dL) and low serum sodium (148 mEq/L), indicating dehydration and possible hypovolemia.\n   - Elevated urea nitrogen (80 mg/dL) and creatinine (2 mg/dL) suggest impaired renal function or decreased renal perfusion.\n\n4. **Analysis of Possible Causes**:\n   - **A. Decreased Renal Perfusion**: This is a plausible cause given the patient's symptoms, dehydration, and laboratory findings indicating hypovolemia. The recent travel to India could be a risk factor for certain infections that affect the kidneys.\n   - **B. IgA Complex Deposition**: While this can cause kidney disease, it typically presents with hematuria (blood in urine) rather than the described laboratory abnormalities.\n   - **C. Glomerulonephritis**: This is an inflammation of the glomeruli and could be a result of various infections or autoimmune diseases. However, it might not fully explain the patient's dehydration and hypotension.\n   - **D. Urinary Tract Obstruction**: This would more likely present with urinary symptoms such as frequency, urgency, and incontinence rather than the described laboratory findings.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Considering the patient's recent travel to India, symptoms of severe systemic infection (diarrhea, vomiting), dehydration, and impaired renal function or decreased perfusion, the most likely cause is a complication related to his travel, such as an infectious disease that affects the kidneys.", "pred_ans": "A", "embedding": [0.008786492, -0.07903109, 0.027389914, -0.016444284, -0.05336513,

{"idx": 1582, "question": "A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain and uneasiness. He says that symptoms onset acutely half an hour ago while he was watching television. He describes the pain as being 8/10 in intensity, sharp in character, localized to the center of the chest and retrosternal, and radiating to the back and shoulders. The patient denies any associated change in the pain with breathing or body position. He says he has associated nausea but denies any vomiting. He denies any recent history of fever, chills, or chronic cough. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus for which he takes lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, simvastatin, and metformin. He reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and has 1\u20132 alcoholic drinks during the weekend. Family history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and an ST elevation myocardial infarction in his father and paternal uncle. His blood pressure is 220/110 mm Hg in the right arm and 180/100 mm Hg in the left arm. On physical examination, the patient is diaphoretic. Cardiac exam reveals a grade 2/6 diastolic decrescendo murmur loudest over the left sternal border. Remainder of the physical examination is normal. The chest radiograph shows a widened mediastinum. The electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals non-specific ST segment and T wave changes. Intravenous morphine and beta-blockers are started. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?", "answer": "Aortic dissection", "options": {"A": "Aortic dissection", "B": "Pulmonary embolism", "C": "Acute myocardial infarction", "D": "Aortic regurgitation"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nThe patient presents with severe chest pain that began acutely, radiating to the back and shoulders, localized to the center of the chest and retrosternal area. This symptomatology is highly suggestive of an aortic dissection, which is characterized by tearing of the inner layer of the aorta, leading to separation of the layers of the aortic wall.\n\nThe patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, as well as his 30-pack-year smoking history, increases his risk for atherosclerotic disease, which is a common cause of aortic dissection. The physical examination findings, including diaphoresis and a grade 2/6 diastolic decrescendo murmur loudest over the left sternal border, are also consistent with an aortic dissection.\n\nThe widened mediastinum on chest radiograph is another important finding that supports the diagnosis of an aortic dissection. The electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals non-specific ST segment and T wave changes, which can be seen in various cardiac conditions but are not specific for aortic dissection.\n\nIntravenous morphine and beta-blockers were started to manage the patient's pain and stabilize his cardiovascular system. However, these measures do not address the underlying cause of the chest pain and may even worsen the situation if the dissection is unstable.\n\nTherefore, considering the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and risk factors for aortic dissection, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is A. Aortic dissection.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\n- B. Pulmonary embolism: While the patient has a history of smoking, which increases his risk for pulmonary embolism, there are no specific findings on the chest radiograph or ECG that would support this diagnosis.\n- C. Acute myocardial infarction: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest an acute myocardial infarction.\n- D. Aortic regurgitation: While aortic regurgitation can cause chest pain, it is typically associated with a systolic murmur rather than a diastolic decrescendo murmur.", "pred_ans": "A", "embedding":

It is determined that in this population, the mean LDL is 200 mg/dL with a standard deviation of 50 mg/dL. If the population has a normal distribution, how many people have a cholesterol less than 300 mg/dL?", "answer": "975", "options": {"A": "680", "B": "840", "C": "975", "D": "997"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a normal distribution and how they apply to the given data.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in a normal distribution, about 68% of the values lie within one standard deviation (SD) of the mean. This is known as the 68-95-99.7 rule or empirical rule.\n\nGiven:\n- Mean (\u03bc) = 200 mg/dL\n- Standard Deviation (\u03c3) = 50 mg/dL\n\nWe want to find out how many people have a cholesterol level less than 300 mg/dL.\n\nTo do this, we need to calculate the z-score for 300 mg/dL. The z-score tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean our value is.\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n= (300 - 200) / 50\n= 100 / 50\n= 2\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a randomly selected person has a cholesterol level less than 300 mg/dL. This corresponds to the area under the normal curve to the left of z = 2.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table (z-table), we look up the z-score of 2 and find the corresponding probability:\n\nP(Z < 2) \u2248 0.9772\n\nThis means that about 97.72% of the population has a cholesterol level less than 300 mg/dL.\n\nSince there are 1000 participants in total, to find out how many people have a cholesterol level less than 300 mg/dL, we multiply the total number of participants by the probability:\n\nNumber of people with LDL < 300 mg/dL = Total participants \u00d7

{"idx": 1590, "question": "A 54-year-old male presents to clinic complaining that he is not sleeping well because he has to get up from bed to urinate multiple times throughout the night. He says that he strains to void, has terminal dribbling, and has urinary urgency. Past medical history is significant for orthostatic hypotension. On digital rectal exam, you note symmetric firm enlargement of the prostate. Free Prostate-Specific-Antigen (PSA) level is 4.6 ng/mL. Before you finish your physical exam, the patient asks if there is anything you can do for his male-pattern baldness. What is the mechanism of action of the drug that would pharmacologically treat this patient\u2019s urinary issues and his male-pattern baldness?", "answer": "5-alpha reductase inhibition", "options": {"A": "Alpha-1 blockade", "B": "Squalene epoxidase inhibition", "C": "5-alpha reductase inhibition", "D": "17,20-desmolase inhibition"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo address this patient's symptoms and concerns, we need to consider both his urinary issues (terminal dribbling, urinary urgency) and male-pattern baldness.\n\nFirstly, let's evaluate the options provided for treating his urinary issues:\n\nA. Alpha-1 blockade - This class of drugs is primarily used to treat hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). While it can help with urinary symptoms by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, it does not address the underlying cause of terminal dribbling and urinary urgency.\n\nB. Squalene epoxidase inhibition - This is a mechanism related to cholesterol synthesis, which is not directly relevant to treating his urinary issues or male-pattern baldness.\n\nC. 5-alpha reductase inhibition - This class of drugs is specifically used to treat BPH by reducing the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent form of androgen that contributes to prostate growth and enlargement. By inhibiting this enzyme, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors can help reduce symptoms such as terminal dribbling and urinary urgency.\n\nD. 17,20-desmolase inhibition - This is another mechanism related to cholesterol synthesis, which is not relevant to treating his urinary issues or male-pattern baldness.\n\nGiven the patient's history of orthostatic hypotension and the need to address both his urinary symptoms (terminal dribbling, urinary urgency) and male-pattern baldness, the most appropriate treatment option would be 5-alpha reductase inhibition. This class of drugs is specifically designed to reduce DHT levels, which can help alleviate symptoms such as terminal dribbling and urinary urgency.", "pred_ans": "C", "embedding": [-0.010017975,

{"idx": 1642, "question": "A 59-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department for the confusion. She was in her usual state of health until about 2 hours ago when she was found trying to cook a frozen pizza in her medicine cabinet. She also complained to her husband that she had a terrible headache. Her past medical history is notable for hypertension, which has been difficult to control on multiple medications. Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), the pulse is 75/min, and the blood pressure is 202/128 mm Hg. On physical exam, she is alert and oriented only to self. The physical exam is otherwise unremarkable and the neurologic exam shows no focal neurological deficits. Noncontrast CT head imaging is unremarkable; a T2-weighted image from the patient\u2019s MRI brain scan is shown. Which of the following is the next best step in management for this patient?", "answer": "IV nicardipine", "options": {"A": "IV lorazepam", "B": "IV nicardipine", "C": "IV phenytoin", "D": "IV vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation of confusion, headache, and unremarkable noncontrast CT head imaging, along with a T2-weighted MRI brain scan showing no focal neurological deficits, the most likely diagnosis is a hypertensive emergency. The patient's history of difficult-to-control hypertension is also a significant concern.\n\nThe next best step in management for this patient would be to initiate aggressive blood pressure reduction to prevent further cerebral damage and potential stroke. Among the options provided:\n\n- A. IV lorazepam: Lorazepam is an anticonvulsant that may not be necessary at this point, as there are no focal neurological deficits on examination.\n- B. IV nicardipine: Nicardipine is a calcium channel blocker that can help reduce blood pressure quickly and effectively. It's often used in hypertensive emergencies due to its rapid onset of action.\n- C. IV phenytoin: Phenytoin is an antiepileptic medication, which may not be the best choice for this patient given her presentation and lack of focal neurological deficits on examination.\n- D. IV vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin: This combination of antibiotics would be more appropriate if there were signs or symptoms suggestive of a bacterial infection, such as fever, altered mental status, or focal neurologic deficits.\n\nGiven the patient's presentation and the need to rapidly reduce blood pressure in a hypertensive emergency, initiating IV nicardipine is the most appropriate next step. This will help to quickly lower her blood pressure and prevent further cerebral damage while allowing time for further diagnostic evaluation and potential initiation of antiepileptic therapy if necessary.", "pred_ans": "B", "embedding": [-0.014715805, -0.0003647861, -0.036432862, 0.07170323, -0.07937669, -0.008250113, -0.0032860204, 0.028406711, -0.05902195, -0.06066439, 0.04807672,

{"idx": 1658, "question": "A 75-year-old man presents to the emergency department for abdominal pain. The patient states the pain started this morning and has been worsening steadily. He decided to come to the emergency department when he began vomiting. The patient has a past medical history of obesity, diabetes, alcohol abuse, and hypertension. His current medications include captopril, insulin, metformin, sodium docusate, and ibuprofen. His temperature is 104.0\u00b0F (40\u00b0C), blood pressure is 160/97 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Abdominal exam reveals left lower quadrant tenderness. Cardiac exam reveals a crescendo systolic murmur heard best by the right upper sternal border. Lab values are ordered and return as below.\n\nHemoglobin: 15 g/dL\nHematocrit: 42%\nLeukocyte count: 19,500 cells/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 226,000/mm^3\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nCl-: 101 mEq/L\nK+: 4.4 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nBUN: 22 mg/dL\nGlucose: 144 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.2 mg/dL\nCa2+: 9.8 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following is the most accurate test for this patient's condition?", "answer": "CT scan", "options": {"A": "Barium enema", "B": "Colonoscopy", "C": "CT scan", "D": "Sigmoidoscopy"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation of abdominal pain, vomiting, and a history of obesity, diabetes, alcohol abuse, and hypertension, along with the physical examination findings of left lower quadrant tenderness and a crescendo systolic murmur, the most likely diagnosis is a gastrointestinal bleed. The presence of hemodynamic instability (elevated blood pressure) and signs of shock (tachycardia, tachypnea, and decreased oxygen saturation) further supports this possibility.\n\nThe patient's laboratory values are also consistent with significant blood loss, as evidenced by the low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated leukocyte count, and thrombocytopenia. The elevated creatinine level may also be related to renal impairment secondary to blood loss.\n\nGiven these findings, a test that can directly visualize the gastrointestinal tract and detect bleeding is necessary. Among the options provided:\n\n- A barium enema (A) is typically used for diagnosing constipation or structural abnormalities of the colon, which are not indicated in this patient's presentation.\n- Colonoscopy (B) involves inserting a flexible tube with a camera into the rectum to visually examine the interior of the colon. While it can be used to diagnose bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract, it is not the most direct test for detecting lower GI bleeding.\n- CT scan (C) is a non-invasive imaging test that can provide detailed images of the abdominal organs and detect bleeding in various locations, including the intestines. It is particularly useful when there are signs of shock or hemodynamic instability due to blood loss.\n- Sigmoidoscopy (D) involves inserting a flexible tube with a camera into the rectum to visually examine the sigmoid colon. While it can be used to diagnose lower GI bleeding, it may not provide as much detail as a CT scan and is less commonly used today due to its invasive nature.\n\nConsidering the patient's presentation and laboratory values, the most accurate test for this condition would be a CT scan (C), which provides detailed images of the abdominal organs and can detect bleeding in various locations, including the intestines.

{"idx": 1659, "question": "A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his brother because of a 3-hour history of lethargy and confusion. The brother says that 2 days ago, the patient ate several large-capped mushrooms he had foraged in the woods. After eating the mushrooms, he developed severe, bloody diarrhea that has since resolved. His pulse is 140/min, respirations are 26/min, and blood pressure is 98/62 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes and tenderness to deep palpation in the right upper quadrant. Serum studies show a serum AST concentration of 2335 U/L and ALT concentration of 2294 U/L. Inhibition of which of the following processes is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?", "answer": "Messenger RNA synthesis", "options": {"A": "Messenger RNA synthesis", "B": "Microtubule polymerization", "C": "Parasympathetic activation", "D": "Cell depolarization"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo approach this question, let's break down the key components of the scenario and analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with lethargy, confusion, dry mucous membranes, tenderness in the right upper quadrant, bloody diarrhea that has resolved, tachycardia (elevated pulse), tachypnea (increased respirations), hypotension (low blood pressure), and elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT).\n\n2. **Recent History**: The patient ate several large-capped mushrooms 2 days ago.\n\n3. **Mushroom Consumption**: Certain mushrooms, particularly Amanita species, can cause liver damage leading to acute liver failure. However, the symptoms described do not directly point towards a typical mushroom poisoning scenario (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain).\n\n4. **Liver Enzymes**: The elevated AST and ALT concentrations indicate liver injury.\n\nGiven these points, we need to consider which process is most likely inhibited in this patient's condition:\n\n- A. Messenger RNA synthesis: This process is crucial for protein synthesis, which is essential for various bodily functions including the production of enzymes that metabolize toxins.\n  \n- B. Microtubule polymerization: This is a step involved in cell division and the formation of cilia and flagella.\n\n- C. Parasympathetic activation: This refers to the stimulation of parasympathetic nervous system activity, which can lead to various physiological effects but is not directly related to liver enzyme inhibition.\n\n- D. Cell depolarization: This process involves the generation of an electrical charge across cell membranes, crucial for muscle contraction and nerve impulses.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms (elevated liver enzymes, bloody diarrhea) and the recent consumption of mushrooms, which are known to cause liver damage, the most likely process inhibited is **Messenger RNA synthesis**. This would lead to a decrease in the production of certain liver enzymes, such as AST and ALT, resulting in their elevation.", "pred_ans": "A", "embedding": [0.054602876, -0.009438676, 0.033178885,

{"idx": 1667, "question": "An investigator is studying the clearance of respiratory particles in healthy non-smokers. An aerosol containing radio-labeled particles that are small enough to reach the alveoli is administered to the subjects via a non-rebreather mask. A gamma scanner is then used to evaluate the rate of particle clearance from the lungs. The primary mechanism of particle clearance most likely involves which of the following cell types?", "answer": "Macrophages", "options": {"A": "Goblet cells", "B": "Type I pneumocytes", "C": "Macrophages", "D": "Neutrophils"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nTo determine the primary mechanism of particle clearance in this scenario, let's consider the role of each cell type mentioned:\n\n- **Goblet cells**: These are responsible for producing and secreting mucus, which helps to trap particles and debris. While goblet cells play a crucial role in respiratory health by protecting against infections and maintaining airway patency, they are not primarily involved in particle clearance.\n\n- **Type I pneumocytes**: These cells line the alveoli and are responsible for gas exchange between the lungs and the bloodstream. They do not have a significant role in particle clearance.\n\n- **Macrophages**: Macrophages are a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the immune response, including phagocytosing (engulfing and digesting) foreign particles and pathogens. In the context of respiratory clearance, macrophages can engulf and remove particulate matter from the alveoli.\n\n- **Neutrophils**: These cells are primarily involved in the innate immune response against bacterial infections and are not typically associated with particle clearance in the lungs.\n\nGiven this information, the primary mechanism of particle clearance most likely involves macrophages, as they play a key role in engulfing and removing particulate matter from the alveoli. This process is crucial for maintaining lung function and overall respiratory health.", "pred_ans": "C", "embedding": [0.062833235, 0.08143658, -0.021123836, 0.031783, 0.027440587, -0.06473458,

{"idx": 1668, "question": "A 35-year-old woman, gravida 4, para 3, at 34 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. She feels well. She does not note any contractions or fluid from her vagina. Her third child was delivered spontaneously at 35 weeks' gestation; pregnancy and delivery of her other two children were uncomplicated. Vital signs are normal. The abdomen is nontender and no contractions are felt. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 34-weeks' gestation. Ultrasonography shows the fetus in a breech presentation. The fetal heart rate is 148/min. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?", "answer": "Observation", "options": {"A": "Cesarean section", "B": "External cephalic version", "C": "Observation", "D": "Intravenous penicillin"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\n### Initial Assessment and Planning:\nThe patient presents with a well-controlled pregnancy at 34 weeks' gestation, no contractions or vaginal fluid, and a normal physical examination. The third pregnancy is uncomplicated, and the previous two were delivered spontaneously without complications.\n\n### Breech Presentation:\nThe ultrasonography confirms breech presentation of the fetus, which requires careful management to avoid any potential complications such as fetal distress or prolonged labor.\n\n### Current Situation:\nGiven that there are no contractions or vaginal fluid, it is unlikely that a cesarean section (A) is immediately necessary. Observation alone may not be sufficient given the risk of fetal distress in breech presentation.\n\n### External Cephalic Version (ECV):\nExternal cephalic version is a procedure where the healthcare provider attempts to manually turn the fetus from a breech position to a head-down position. However, this option carries risks and is generally considered for patients with a history of failed external cephalic versions or those who are at high risk for complications.\n\n### Intravenous Penicillin:\nIntravenous penicillin is not indicated in this scenario as there is no indication of infection.\n\n### Most Appropriate Next Step:\nGiven the current situation, the most appropriate next step would be to monitor the fetal heart rate closely and assess the progress of labor. This can be done by performing a non-stress test (NST) or biophysical profile (BPP), which evaluate the well-being of the fetus based on its movement, tone, breathing movements, and amniotic fluid volume.\n\n### Monitoring:\nThe patient's vital signs are normal, and there is no indication of fetal distress. The ultrasonography shows a uterus consistent in size with a 34-weeks' gestation, which supports the current situation. A non-stress test or BPP can be performed to assess the fetal well-being without immediately proceeding to more invasive procedures.", "pred_ans": "C", "embedding": [0.08179389, 0.025171159,

{"idx": 1739, "question": "A 51-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of an aggressive cough with copious amounts of thick, foamy, yellow-green sputum. She says she has had this cough for about 11 years with exacerbations similar to her presentation today. She also reports that her cough is worse in the morning. She was evaluated multiple times in the past because of recurrent bouts of bronchitis that have required treatment with antibiotics. She is a non-smoker. On physical examination, the blood pressure is 125/78 mm Hg, pulse rate is 80/min, respiratory rate is 16/min, and temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F). Chest auscultation reveals crackles and wheezing over the right middle lobe and the rest of her physical examinations are normal. The chest X-ray shows irregular opacities in the right middle lobe and diffuse airway thickening. Based on this history and physical examination, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "answer": "Bronchiectasis", "options": {"A": "Tuberculosis", "B": "Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency", "C": "Bronchiectasis", "D": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's long-standing history of cough with recurrent bouts of bronchitis, which has required treatment with antibiotics, and her current presentation of an aggressive cough with copious amounts of thick, foamy, yellow-green sputum, along with exacerbations similar to her previous presentations, we can consider several potential diagnoses. However, the key findings on physical examination that are most relevant to this case include the presence of crackles and wheezing over the right middle lobe, which suggests an obstructive process affecting the lung parenchyma.\n\nThe chest X-ray findings of irregular opacities in the right middle lobe and diffuse airway thickening further support the diagnosis of a condition that affects the lung parenchyma. Considering these factors, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Tuberculosis (TB) - While TB can cause chronic cough and sputum production, it typically presents with more systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and night sweats, which are not mentioned in this case.\n\nB. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency - This is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs, liver, and pancreas. It can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but it typically presents at an older age than 51 years.\n\nC. Bronchiectasis - This condition involves permanent enlargement of parts of the airways, which can lead to recurrent infections and sputum production. However, bronchiectasis is more commonly associated with a history of chronic cough and sputum production that has not responded to treatment, as well as findings on imaging such as dilated bronchi and bronchial wall thickening.\n\nD. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - This condition is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible and is typically associated with a history of smoking or exposure to noxious particles. The patient's non-smoker status, along with the presence of exacerbations similar to her previous presentations, makes COPD less likely.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely diagnosis in this case is bronchiectasis, as it aligns with the patient's long-standing cough and recurrent bouts of bronchitis, which have not responded to treatment. The physical examination findings and chest X-ray results further support this diagnosis.", "pred_ans": "C", "embedding": [0.039732177, 0.0047404715, -0.024430914, 0.04126005, 0.013697132,

{"idx": 1770, "question": "A hospitalized 45-year-old man has had mild flank pain since awakening 3 hours ago. He also reports a new generalized rash. Two weeks ago, he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis. Current medications include isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyridoxine. His temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F), pulse is 74/min, and blood pressure is 128/72 mm Hg. Examination of the skin shows diffuse erythema with confluent papules.

Initiate hemodialysis - Hemodialysis may be necessary in severe cases of acute kidney injury (e.g., with high serum urea nitrogen levels or significant proteinuria), but it is not indicated as a first step without further evaluation and assessment of the patient's renal function.\n\nB. Administer ciprofloxacin - Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that can be used in combination with other antituberculosis medications, including rifampin. However, initiating ciprofloxacin without considering potential interactions or alternatives may not be the most appropriate next step.\n\nC. Discontinue rifampin - Rifampin is a critical component of the standard treatment regimen for pulmonary tuberculosis and is often discontinued before starting other antitubercular medications to avoid potential drug interactions. However, discontinuing rifampin abruptly can lead to severe withdrawal symptoms in patients who are highly sensitive to its effects.\n\nD. Perform renal biopsy - A renal biopsy may be considered if there is a high suspicion of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or another cause of the patient's flank pain and laboratory findings. However, this would not be the most appropriate next step without further evaluation and assessment of the patient's renal function.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most appropriate next step in management would be to discontinue rifampin, as it is a critical component of the standard treatment regimen for pulmonary tuberculosis and can cause severe withdrawal symptoms if discontinued abruptly. This decision should be made with caution and under close monitoring, considering potential interactions or alternatives that may be safer.", "pred_ans": "C", "embedding": [0.008863042, -0.024783086,

He states that he is in good health but has had decreasing exercise tolerance and increased levels of shortness of breath over the past 5 years. He believed that it was due to aging; he has not seen a doctor in 10 years. On auscultation, you note an early diastolic decrescendo blowing murmur that radiates along the left sternal border. In the United States, what is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?", "answer": "Congenital bicuspid aortic valve", "options": {"A": "Syphilis", "B": "Connective tissue disease", "C": "Myxomatous degeneration", "D": "Congenital bicuspid aortic valve"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we can approach this question by considering the possible causes of a diastolic decrescendo blowing murmur radiating along the left sternal border.\n\nFirstly, let's consider the patient's age and history. The patient is 32 years old and has not seen a doctor in 10 years, which raises concerns about his overall health and potential underlying conditions that may have been missed or misdiagnosed over time.\n\nThe physical examination finding of an early diastolic decrescendo blowing murmur radiating along the left sternal border is highly suggestive of aortic regurgitation (AR). This type of murmur is characterized by a continuous, low-pitched sound that decreases in intensity with respiration and increases with exercise. The fact that it radiates along the left sternal border also points towards aortic regurgitation.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible causes of AR:\n\nA. Syphilis: While syphilis can cause various cardiovascular abnormalities, including aortic regurgitation, it is not the most common cause in this age group.\n\nB. Connective tissue disease: Connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus can cause aortic regurgitation, but they are less likely to be associated with this specific physical examination finding.\n\nC. Myxomatous degeneration: This condition is more commonly associated with mitral valve prolapse rather than aortic regurgitation.\n\nD. Congenital bicuspid aortic valve: This is the most common cause of aortic regurgitation in adults, particularly those who have not undergone surgical correction for their congenital heart defect. The patient's age and lack of previous medical history make this option highly plausible.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely cause of his condition is congenital bicuspid aortic valve (D).

{"idx": 1835, "question": "A 40-year-old man presents with a rash, oral lesions, and vision problems for 5 days. He says the rash started as a burning feeling on his face and the upper part of his torso, but soon red spots appeared in that same distribution. The spots grew in size and spread to his upper extremities. The patient says the spots are painful but denies any associated pruritus. He says the painful oral lesions appeared about the same time as the rash. For the past 3 days, he also says he has been having double vision and dry, itchy eyes. He reports that he had a mild upper respiratory infection for a few days that preceded his current symptoms. The patient denies any chills, hematuria, abdominal or chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. Past medical history is significant for a severe urinary tract infection diagnosed 3 weeks ago for which he has been taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The vital signs include: temperature 38.3\u2103 (101.0\u2109), blood pressure 110/60 mm Hg, respiratory rate 20/min, and pulse 108/min. On physical examination, the patient has severe painful erosions of the oral mucosa. There are multiple fluid-filled vesicles and bullae averaging 3 mm in diameter with a surrounding erythematous ring that involve only the upper torso and extensor surfaces of upper extremities. Several of the lesions have ruptured, resulting in sloughing off of the epidermal layer. There is a prominent conjunctival injection present. Ophthalmic examination reveals mild bilateral corneal abrasions without any evidence of frank ulceration. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:\nWhite blood cell (WBC) count 8,500/mm3\nRed blood cell (RBC) count 4.20 x 106/mm3\nHematocrit 41.5%\nHemoglobin 14.0 g/dL\nPlatelet count 215,000/mm3\nC-reactive protein (CRP) 86 mg/L\nUrine and blood cultures are pending. Which of the following would confirm the most likely diagnosis in this patient?\n ", "answer": "Biopsy and histopathologic analysis of skin lesions", "options": {"A": "Gram stain and culture of skin sample", "B": "Biopsy and histopathologic analysis of skin lesions", "C": "Direct immunofluorescence analysis of perilesional skin biopsy", "D": "Flow cytometry"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the clinical presentation of this patient, which includes a rash that started on the face and upper torso, oral lesions with painful erosions, vision problems (double vision and dry, itchy eyes), and fluid-filled vesicles/bullae, along with laboratory findings indicating an infection (elevated WBC count, CRP) and signs of inflammation (conjunctival injection, mild corneal abrasions), the most likely diagnosis is a condition known as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS).\n\nThe presence of oral lesions, particularly painful erosions, suggests mucosal involvement. The rash's distribution and the patient's symptoms further support this diagnosis. SJS is characterized by a distinct set of criteria that must be met to diagnose it, including the presence of two or more of the following: \n\n- A rash that covers more than 10% of the body surface area\n- Oral lesions with mucosal involvement (e.g., painful erosions)\n- Conjunctival injection\n- Serositis (inflammation of the serous membranes surrounding the heart, lungs, liver, and spleen)\n\nThe laboratory findings also support this diagnosis. The elevated WBC count and CRP indicate an ongoing inflammatory process.\n\nGiven these criteria, the most appropriate diagnostic test to confirm the diagnosis would be a biopsy and histopathologic analysis of skin lesions (B). This is because SJS is characterized by specific changes in the skin, such as the presence of necrotic keratinocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils, which can be visualized through histopathological examination.\n\nThe other options are not as directly relevant to diagnosing SJS:\n\n- Gram stain and culture of a skin sample (A) would be more appropriate for diagnosing bacterial infections.\n- Direct immunofluorescence analysis of perilesional skin biopsy (C) is typically used to diagnose conditions such as dermatomyositis or lupus erythematosus, not SJS.\n- Flow cytometry (D) may be useful in diagnosing certain hematological disorders but is not the most appropriate test for this patient's condition.", "pred_ans": "B", "embedding": [0.02648784, -0.020059193, -0.02750003, 0.022971353,

{"idx": 1839, "question": "A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a 4-month history of reddening of the nose and cheeks. She has no itching or pain. She first noticed the redness while on a recent holiday in Spain, where she stayed at the beach and did daily wine tastings. She has tried several brands of sunscreen, stopped going outside in the middle of the day, and has not drunk alcohol since her trip, but the facial redness persists. She has no history of serious illness. Her younger sister has acne vulgaris, and her mother has systemic lupus erythematosus. The patient reports that she has had a lot of stress lately due to relationship problems with her husband. She does not smoke. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows erythema of the nose, chin, and medial cheeks with scant papules and telangiectasias. There are no comedones or blisters. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. In addition to behavioral modifications, which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment?", "answer": "Topical metronidazole", "options": {"A": "Topical corticosteroids", "B": "Topical benzoyl peroxide", "C": "Oral isotretinoin", "D": "Topical metronidazole"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and history, it is essential to consider the potential causes of her condition, which includes a possible allergic or inflammatory etiology given the erythema, papules, and telangiectasias. The fact that she has tried various sunscreens without relief suggests an issue with her skin's response to sunlight.\n\nThe patient's stress levels could be contributing to her symptoms, as stress is known to exacerbate conditions like acne vulgaris and rosacea. However, the presence of erythema on the nose, chin, and medial cheeks, along with scant papules and telangiectasias, suggests a more systemic issue rather than just localized acne.\n\nConsidering these factors, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\nA. Topical corticosteroids: While topical corticosteroids can be effective for mild to moderate rosacea, they may not address the underlying cause of this patient's symptoms and could potentially worsen her condition if used excessively or without proper medical supervision.\n\nB. Topical benzoyl peroxide: Benzoyl peroxide is commonly used in the treatment of acne vulgaris but might not be sufficient for addressing the erythema and papules seen in this patient.\n\nC. Oral isotretinoin: Isotretinoin is a powerful oral retinoid that is typically reserved for severe, resistant, or life-threatening cases of rosacea. Given the patient's age (40) and the severity of her symptoms, oral isotretinoin might be considered an option, but it carries significant risks, including birth defects if used during pregnancy.\n\nD. Topical metronidazole: Metronidazole is an antibiotic that can be effective against mild to moderate acne vulgaris and rosacea. It may also have anti-inflammatory properties, which could help with the erythema and papules seen in this patient.\n\nGiven the potential benefits of topical metronidazole for addressing the erythema and papules without the significant risks associated with oral isotretinoin, it appears to be the most appropriate initial treatment option for this patient. However, it is essential to note that further evaluation and possibly a prescription-strength formulation may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and optimize treatment.", "pred_ans": "D",

{"idx": 1875, "question": "A 7-day-old female newborn is brought to the physician because of lethargy, vomiting, poor feeding, and diarrhea for 4 days. She was born at 39 weeks' gestation. Vital signs are within normal limits. Bilateral cataracts and icterus are present. Examination shows jaundice of the skin, and the liver is palpated 5-cm below the right costal margin. Muscle tone is decreased in all extremities. Serum glucose concentration is 40 mg/dL. Which of the following metabolites is most likely to be increased in this patient?", "answer": "Galactose-1-phosphate", "options": {"A": "Sphingomyelin", "B": "Uric acid", "C": "Branched-chain amino acids", "D": "Galactose-1-phosphate"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the clinical presentation of lethargy, vomiting, poor feeding, diarrhea, jaundice, decreased muscle tone, and elevated serum glucose concentration in a 7-day-old female newborn, we can deduce that this patient is suffering from hypoglycemia due to an inability to properly metabolize glucose.\n\nThe presence of bilateral cataracts and icterus (jaundice) further supports the diagnosis of hypoglycemia. The liver palpation finding of a liver 5-cm below the right costal margin suggests hepatomegaly, which is also consistent with hypoglycemia due to glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis being impaired.\n\nThe serum glucose concentration of 40 mg/dL confirms that the patient has hypoglycemia. Given these findings, we can consider the potential causes of hypoglycemia in newborns.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Sphingomyelin is a component of cell membranes and is not directly related to glucose metabolism.\nB. Uric acid is a waste product that can be elevated in various conditions but is not directly related to glucose metabolism or hypoglycemia.\nC. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are important for protein synthesis, but their levels would more likely be affected by other metabolic disturbances rather than causing hypoglycemia.\nD. Galactose-1-phosphate is a metabolite that accumulates in the liver due to impaired glucose metabolism, particularly in the context of galactosemia or glycogen storage diseases.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely cause of this patient's hypoglycemia is an inability to properly metabolize galactose, which leads to a buildup of galactose-1-phosphate.

Similarly, the absence of pain, swelling, flashes, floaters, or headaches makes conditions like acute ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) and posterior ischemic retinopathy (PIR) less likely.\n\nThe patient's past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension is also relevant because it increases her risk for atherosclerotic disease, which can lead to embolic events. The fact that she takes nitroglycerin as needed suggests she may be on medications that could increase the risk of thromboembolism.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is occlusion of the ophthalmic artery by an embolus. This can occur due to atherosclerosis or other vascular diseases and would lead to sudden loss of vision in one eye without any preceding trauma or inflammation.\n\nThe fundus examination findings of

{"idx": 1943, "question": "A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department for a fever and abdominal pain. The patient states that his pain has been worsening over the past week in the setting of a fever. He has a past medical history of IV drug abuse and multiple admissions for septic shock. His temperature is 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 94/54 mmHg, pulse is 133/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a murmur over the left upper sternal border. Abdominal exam reveals left upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.\n\nHemoglobin: 15 g/dL\nHematocrit: 44%\nLeukocyte count: 16,700/mm^3\nPlatelet count: 299,000/mm^3\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "answer": "Splenic abscess", "options": {"A": "Diverticulitis", "B": "Hepatic abscess", "C": "Mesenteric ischemia", "D": "Splenic abscess"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation, we can start by considering the key elements of his history and physical exam findings.\n\n1. **History of IV drug abuse**: This increases the risk for infections, including abscesses or septicemia.\n2. **Multiple admissions for septic shock**: This suggests a high level of severity and potential for ongoing infection or inflammation.\n3. **Fever and worsening abdominal pain over the past week**: These symptoms are concerning for an acute abdomen or an infectious process.\n4. **Physical exam findings**:\n   - A murmur over the left upper sternal border is suggestive of cardiac involvement, which could be related to septic shock or another underlying condition.\n   - Left upper quadrant tenderness on abdominal exam is consistent with liver or spleen pathology.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\n- **Diverticulitis (A)**: While diverticulitis can cause abdominal pain and fever, it typically presents with more localized symptoms such as left lower quadrant pain rather than left upper quadrant tenderness.\n- **Hepatic abscess (B)**: This is a possibility given the patient's history of IV drug abuse and multiple admissions for septic shock. Hepatic abscesses can cause fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice, but they are less likely to present with a murmur over the left upper sternal border.\n- **Mesenteric ischemia (C)**: This condition is characterized by reduced blood flow to the intestines, which can lead to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and potentially life-threatening complications. However, it typically presents with more diffuse abdominal pain rather than localized tenderness or a specific murmur.\n- **Splenic abscess (D)**: Given the patient's history of IV drug abuse and multiple admissions for septic shock, splenic involvement is highly plausible. Splenic abscesses can cause fever, abdominal pain, and a palpable spleen on physical exam. The presence of a murmur over the left upper sternal border could be related to cardiac involvement or another underlying condition.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most likely diagnosis is **D. Splenic abscess**, as it aligns with the patient's history of IV drug abuse, multiple admissions for septic shock, and physical exam findings suggestive of splenic pathology.", "pred_ans": "D",

{"idx": 1949, "question": "A 34-year-old patient with a history of anxiety, chronic constipation, chronic headaches, and chronic hypertension presents to the emergency room with severe right flank pain radiating to his scrotum. A urinalysis with stone analysis is performed and the results are shown in figure A. Prior to discharge, it is noted that the patients BP is still 170/110 mmHg. Furthermore, his calcium and PTH levels were both found to be increased. Which of the following representative histology slides of thyroid tissue represents a potential complication of the patients condition?", "answer": "Medullary thyroid cancer", "options": {"A": "Medullary thyroid cancer", "B": "Papillary thyroid cancer", "C": "Lymphoma", "D": "Follicular thyroid cancer"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the patient's presentation with severe right flank pain radiating to his scrotum, along with chronic symptoms such as anxiety, constipation, headaches, and hypertension, it is essential to consider a differential diagnosis that could explain these symptoms. The presence of stone analysis in the urinalysis and elevated calcium and PTH levels are particularly noteworthy.\n\nThe patient's symptoms can be linked to hyperparathyroidism, which is often associated with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). PHPT is characterized by an overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by one or more of the four parathyroid glands. This excess PTH leads to increased calcium levels in the blood and can cause a range of symptoms including bone pain, kidney stones, and hypertension.\n\nThe histological features of thyroid tissue that could represent a potential complication of PHPT include:\n\n- **Medullary thyroid cancer (A)**: While medullary thyroid cancer is a type of thyroid cancer, it is not typically associated with the biochemical abnormalities seen in PHPT. However, it can occur in conjunction with PHPT.\n  \n- **Papillary thyroid cancer (B)**: Papillary thyroid cancer is another common type of thyroid cancer but is not directly related to the biochemical profile or symptoms described.\n\n- **Lymphoma (C)**: Lymphoma can be associated with various conditions, including autoimmune disorders and malignancies. However, it is less commonly linked to PHPT compared to other options.\n\n- **Follicular thyroid cancer (D)**: Follicular thyroid cancer is a type of thyroid cancer that originates from the follicular cells of the thyroid gland. It can be associated with various conditions, including autoimmune disorders and malignancies. However, it is not typically linked to PHPT or the biochemical abnormalities described.\n\nConsidering the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely histological slide representing a potential complication of his condition would be medullary thyroid cancer, as it is closely associated with PHPT and can occur in conjunction with this condition.", "pred_ans": "A",

This study is best described as which of the following?", "answer": "Ecological study", "options": {"A": "Case-control study", "B": "Ecological study", "C": "Case series", "D": "Double-blind clinical trial"}, "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nThe study described is an ecological study, specifically a case-control study.\n\n- The investigators examined per capita income and rates of syphilis in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston.\n- This suggests that the researchers are looking at the relationship between two variables (per capita income and syphilis rates) to identify potential associations or correlations.\n- However, the fact that they found a higher number of new cases of syphilis was higher in low-income neighborhoods implies that the relationship is not causal but rather observational. This is characteristic of an ecological study.\n\nIn particular, this type of study is known as a case-control study because it involves comparing individuals with a specific outcome (cases) to those without the outcome (controls), looking back in time to identify potential exposures or risk factors. However, since the question mentions that the investigators found a higher number of new cases was higher in low-income neighborhoods, this suggests an ecological study rather than a case-control
