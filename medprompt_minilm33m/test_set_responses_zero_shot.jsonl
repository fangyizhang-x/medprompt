{"question": "A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?", "answer": "Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake", "options": {"A": "Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report", "B": "Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake", "C": "Report the physician to the ethics committee", "D": "Refuse to dictate the operative report"}, "meta_info": "step1", "answer_idx": "B", "metamap_phrases": ["junior orthopaedic surgery resident", "completing", "carpal tunnel repair", "department chairman", "attending physician", "case", "resident", "cuts", "flexor tendon", "tendon", "repaired", "complication", "attending", "resident", "patient", "fine", "need to report", "minor complication", "not", "patient", "not", "to make", "patient worry", "resident to leave", "complication out", "operative report", "following", "correct next action", "resident to take"], "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven the situation, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Disclosing the error to the patient and putting it in the operative report would be the most appropriate course of action. This is because patients have a right to know about any complications or errors that may affect their care, including minor ones like this one.\n\nB. Telling the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake would not be an effective solution. The attending physician has already made it clear that he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily, which is a valid concern for patients.\n\nC. Reporting the physician to the ethics committee might seem like a viable option, but it's unlikely to be effective in this situation. Ethics committees typically focus on more serious issues, such as patient safety or malpractice, rather than minor errors that do not significantly impact patient care.\n\nD. Refusing to dictate the operative report would not be an appropriate response. As a resident, it is part of one's duty to accurately and truthfully document the case, including any complications or errors that may occur during surgery.\n\nGiven these considerations, disclosing the error to the patient and putting it in the operative report is the most appropriate next action for the resident.", "pred_ans": null}
{"question": "A 67-year-old man with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of ringing sensation in his ear. He received this first course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 week ago. Pure tone audiometry shows a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB. The expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to which of the following actions?", "answer": "Cross-linking of DNA", "options": {"A": "Inhibition of proteasome", "B": "Hyperstabilization of microtubules", "C": "Generation of free radicals", "D": "Cross-linking of DNA"}, "meta_info": "step1", "answer_idx": "D", "metamap_phrases": ["67 year old man", "transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder", "physician", "2-day history", "ringing sensation", "ear", "received", "first course", "neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 week", "Pure tone audiometry shows", "sensorineural hearing loss", "dB", "expected beneficial effect", "drug", "caused", "patient's symptoms", "most likely due to", "following actions"], "cot": "(model generated chain of thought explanation)\n\nGiven that the patient has transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and received a first course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 week ago, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. The patient's symptoms are a ringing sensation in his ear, which is likely tinnitus.\n2. Pure tone audiometry shows a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB.\n\nThe expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms would most likely be due to its ability to cross-link DNA, as this action can lead to cell death and inhibit tumor growth.\n\nConsidering these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Inhibition of proteasome - This is a mechanism of action for some chemotherapy drugs, such as bortezomib (Velcade), but it is not directly related to cross-linking DNA.\nB. Hyperstabilization of microtubules - This is also a mechanism of action for some chemotherapy drugs, such as vinca alkaloids and taxanes, but it is not directly related to cross-linking DNA.\nC. Generation of free radicals - This is a mechanism of action for some chemotherapy drugs, such as platinum-based agents (e.g., cisplatin), which can generate reactive oxygen species that damage DNA and lead to cell death. However, this option does not specifically relate to the expected beneficial effect in terms of cross-linking DNA.\nD. Cross-linking of DNA - This is a mechanism of action for some chemotherapy drugs, such as alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide), which can cause cross-links between DNA strands and lead to cell death.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is its ability to cross-link DNA.", "pred_ans": null}
